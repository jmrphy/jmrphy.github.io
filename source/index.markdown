How have economic and political processes pacified our capacity for radical collective action? How can we overthrow all these rotten institutions which dominate our lives?</b> As a political scientist, I focus on the crucial roles played by information, communication, and media in the pacification of political resistance. As an activist, I'm just one of many people helping to build revolutionary resistance to status quo institutions. Before joining the faculty of Politics and IR at the University of Southampton in the UK, I did my PhD at Temple University in the US. There I was active in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OccupyPhiladelphia">Occupy Wall Street</a>, some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x4cuw2Yo6w">civil disobedience</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4fmN6O-DTQ">shutting down of things</a>, some longer-term <a href="http://gophare.org">campaigns against the big U.S. banks</a>, and sundry other <a href="http://jmrphy.tumblr.com/reviews">works and deeds</a>, including a <a href="http://jmrphy.tumblr.com/tagged/ox">radical warehouse project</a> where I lived for nearly three years. To receive a weekly first-look at my current projects, you can subscribe to my newsletter below.</a></p>
