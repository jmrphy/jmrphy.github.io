How have economic and political processes pacified our capacity for radical collective action?</b> As a political scientist, I am interested in the roles played by information, communication, and ideology in the pacification of political resistance and conflict. Before joining the faculty of Politics and IR at the University of Southampton in the UK, I did my PhD at Temple University in the US. There I was active in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OccupyPhiladelphia">Occupy Wall Street</a>, some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x4cuw2Yo6w">civil disobedience</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4fmN6O-DTQ">shutting down of things</a>, some longer-term <a href="http://gophare.org">campaigns against the big U.S. banks</a>, and sundry other <a href="http://jmrphy.tumblr.com/reviews">works and deeds</a>, including a <a href="http://jmrphy.tumblr.com/tagged/ox">radical warehouse project</a> where I lived for nearly three years. I am currently an active member of the revolutionary anti-capitalist group <a href="http://www.weareplanc.org/">Plan C</a>. If you're interested in receiving updates on my current projects, I put out a regular newsletter which you can <a href="https://tinyletter.com/jmrphy">sign up for here.</a></p>
