I'm a political scientist and theorist based at the University of Southampton, UK, as of Fall 2013. Most of my research revolves around what I think is one of the most puzzling aspects of contemporary global capitalism: mass public quiescence. Despite recent waves of unrest, why is there not more outrage, more protest, more revolt against inequality and exploitation? And how do these patterns of quiescence explain economic outcomes?

My academic research thus far approaches this general puzzle by examining why variations in mass media environments cause individuals and countries to respond differently to economic globalization. Somewhat uniquely, my research relies heavily on quantitative methods but theoretically my perspective is most deeply informed by the critical and revolutionary canons. Given that radical theory and quantitative methods are rarely discussed together, I'm very interested in both radicalizing positive social science and extending the radical theoretical tradition with more quantitative techniques.

Here and elsewhere, I also write creatively and experimentally about assorted topics--mostly theory, social science, radical resistance and revolution, data hacking and statistical analysis, autobiography. In graduate school, I wrote and lived under a nom de guerre of sorts, Barclay Shields. Since receiving my first academic appointment, I've decided to bring my radical/experimental projects and academic work under the same roof. This website is that roof. An integral existence is perhaps my chief intellectual and political project.
