<p>I'm a writer, theorist, social scientist, teacher, militant. In Fall 2013 I join the faculty of Politics and International Relations at the University of Southampton, UK.  Nearly all of my intellectual and political work revolves around the puzzle I'm most interested in: why isn't there more resistance to capitalism? As an academic researcher I focus on political economy and mass media, with a longer-term view of bringing quantitative methods to bear on unsolved riddles from the revolutionary tradition. Before I came to the UK, I did my Ph.D. at Temple University in the US, where I was active in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OccupyPhiladelphia">Occupy Wall Street</a>, some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x4cuw2Yo6w">civil disobedience</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4fmN6O-DTQ">shutting down of things</a>, some longer-term <a href="http://gophare.org">campaigns against the big U.S. banks</a>, and sundry other <a href="http://barclayshields.tumblr.com/">works and deeds</a>, including a <a href="http://distilleryimage7.s3.amazonaws.com/54afdd5a256a11e2bcd822000a9f129c_7.jpg">radical warehouse project</a> where I lived for nearly three years.
