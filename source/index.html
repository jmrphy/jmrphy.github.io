<p>I'm a writer, theorist, social scientist, teacher, militant. In Fall 2013 I joined the faculty of Politics and International Relations at the University of Southampton, UK.  Nearly all of my intellectual and political work revolves around the puzzle: why is there not more resistance to the status quo? How do institutions and ideological apparatuses pacify various types of political resistance? As an academic researcher so far I have mostly focused on political economy and mass media, with a longer-term view of bringing quantitative methods to bear on unsolved riddles from the revolutionary tradition. Before I came to the UK, I did my Ph.D. at Temple University in the US, where I was active in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OccupyPhiladelphia">Occupy Wall Street</a>, some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x4cuw2Yo6w">civil disobedience</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4fmN6O-DTQ">shutting down of things</a>, some longer-term <a href="http://gophare.org">campaigns against the big U.S. banks</a>, and sundry other <a href="http://jmrphy.tumblr.com/reviews">works and deeds</a>, including a <a href="http://jmrphy.tumblr.com/tagged/ox">radical warehouse project</a> where I lived for nearly three years.
