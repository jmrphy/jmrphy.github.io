[Introduction to Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences (Undergraduate)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/enwj4f2bggewhn7/Murphy_Syllabus_Sec12.pdf)

This course is an introduction to quantitative research methods for students interested 
in becoming intelligent and engaged, data-analytical citizens. It will be especially useful 
for students pursuing careers in social science or policy analysis, but a basic working 
knowledge of statistics and data analysis should be useful, interesting, and empowering 
for anyone. Weâ€™ll be dealing with some of the best known techniques for asking and 
answering questions about society, and the basic concepts and mathematics 
underwriting them.
