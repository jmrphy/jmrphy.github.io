For the past two minutes I’ve been   
Typing with one hand because   
In the other hand was a bagel,   
Until I ate it all.   
I liked the bagel and I like   
Typing like this and   
And it all just made   
Me think I would like   
To write you a poem in this   
Fashion because poems let one say   
Many serious things at once   
And not be too serious   
Or many stupid things at once   
And seem interesting or deep or   
Profound or even trenchant.   

The bagel was not a metaphor,   
Just how this really happened,   
Although it is also a metaphor,   
The bagel being you,   
And the typing being   
A female minimalist lo-fi electro pop   
Musician playing a “synth,”   
A thing that works   
I know not how.   

Anyway, the plan for this “piece,”   
Is to read it to you one day or night   
In your studio, which has very low lighting   
By the way,   
At a time when you’ve just finished working,   
And make you think   
I’m serious but not too serious and   
Interesting or deep or profound   
Or even trenchant and maybe make   
You like me just a little bit more than   
Maybe you do now maybe.   
Today I saw one of my best friends   
In the world and she cried because   
Her boyfriend dumped her and I   
Cried too because her boyfriend   
Dumped her and it made her cry.   
I hope you don’t get a boyfriend   
Because I don’t want you to cry if   
he dumps you but I   
don’t think he would   
do that, although if he did   
I would secretly be happy.   

I thought for a second that   
I might try to “express my feelings”   
To you in this poem,   
But then it occurred to me that   
I could just keep “beating around the bush”   
And write hundreds of poems   
Just kind of “getting to the point”   
And just never quite “get to the point,”   
And that this would probably   
Make greater works of art   
Than somehow just “getting to the point,”   
Which I can’t really do outside of poetry so   
Why would I be able to do it inside of poetry   
Inside of your art studio,   
Which has low lighting,   
By the way?   

The low lighting, by the way,   
Is not a metaphor,   
Just how this is really happening,   
Although it is also a metaphor,   
The light being the truth itself or   
A female minimalist lo-fi electro pop   
Musician playing a “synth,”   
The light’s low level being   
How the “synth” works,   
Which I do not know about.   

Anyway, the reason this “piece”   
Has to be performed in your studio   
Is that when you are not working   
For money this is always where   
You want to be with your free time   
First and foremost and then when   
You are done sometimes we   
Hang out maybe and when I have   
Free time I read and write   
First and foremost and then when   
I am done sometimes we hang out maybe   
And this might seem like a stupidly trivial   
Observation but since now   
It’s in a poem and I am reading it   
In your art studio, which has very low   
Lighting by the way, it kind of   
Represents how what you do here   
First and foremost   
Is the most important thing   
And what I do elsewhere   
First and foremost    
Is the most important thing and now,   
Right here, the two most imporant   
Things are kind of in the   
Same place so that as soon as I   
Finish reading the last word of this   
I guess the truth is I’m just hoping   
That you’ll like me just a little more   
Than maybe you do now maybe,   
(And I’ll like you a little more too, maybe)   
Because as I finish reading the very last word,   
Even though I never really expressed   
Anything clearly or “got to the point,”   
The air in your studio   
Which has low lighting by the way,   
will sort of vibrate   
For a tenth of a second and   
I think that will be art.
