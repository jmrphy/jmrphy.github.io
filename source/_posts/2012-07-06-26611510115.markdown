Figure 4 represents the random mutation of what is most commonly thought of as the idea or thought, but which is simply a new thing: the map. The appearance of the “idea” as well as the character of material objectivity are different intensive things modeled on a map-thing. It is easy to see that a map, any map, implies infinity by virtue of the map’s finitude, by virtue of having produced horizons. In a certain register, much has been made of language as a "cut." By "map" we simply mean the more general class of human tools that serve to cut the fabric of materiality with a materiality that produces intensive things. There is now always a beyond of the horizon, a beyond that enlarging the map can never once and for all integrate but only defer. When some thing randomly generates a map and thus bifurcates things into extensive things (referents of the map) and intensive things (relations constructed on or, rather, _in_ the map) it is not as if the evolution of a prior physical and material realm is producing a new realm called the "mental" realm. The very opposition between mental and physical is only a relation mapped on a plane of immanence. Thus, the map is simply a new thing of a particular character.
