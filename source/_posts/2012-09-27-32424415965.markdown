I haven’t had fun in a whole year because I have been a serious man, an ambitious young academic who is serious. I have been putting my ducks in a row. But the ducks are getting ill. I’m getting off the duck bus, fucking idiot I am. Unless they scatter immediately I will kill the ducks unless they kill me. Every bus is a duck bus if you ask me, and you are asking me. I just ate a $3 vegan burger and now I’m at an Afghani place smoking a hookah, reading Agamben, and drawing idiotic diagrams on my iPad. There is a crisis in higher education. I am the crisis. I feel good and nice and quite right about being a crisis.
