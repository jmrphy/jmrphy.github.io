The truth is that most people do not want other people to flourish. We all support a general idea of everyone being freer but we tend to feel threatened whenever anyone *in particular* meets with an increase of freedom. Not long after, we begin to hate them for it if we are not welcome or able to enjoy in the proceeds.
