At 2:44 a.m. I was going to the roof   
And in the stairwell it was cold   
A little and smelled like burning wood,    
Maybe smoking hickory in a fireplace,   
Although I honestly don't know what   
Hickory in particular smells like,   
Burning or otherwise.   

And on my way up the staircase   
After the cold and the smoke of hickory   
I thought about you and how   
I wanted it to get colder   
Because I like you.   
And when I got to the threshold   
Of the door   
To the roof   
I saw that the smell of fireplace hickory   
Was a plume of hot black fog   
Which the 9-11 respondent told me   
Was a mobile home on fire.   

I went to videotape the fire   
but there were many many many   
Police and firefighters so   
I filmed a little and then stopped   
Because I felt like the police might   
Think I did it and was recording it   
Now as reverse psychology like if   
I did it I would never come back to   
Record it in front of cops so that's   
Why I came back to record it,   
They would think.   
So I went home and opened   
The front door and   
Thought to myself   
I guess I live in a police state.   

I think true love is like a police state   
Except you don't get the right to remain silent   
Or even an overworked public defender,   
Or free food like in prison,   
Except you do get love,   
Which is like sharing a bunk   
In the prison house of language   
I guess.   

I made a plastic bowl of soup   
By just pouring hot water on it   
And I took it back up to the roof   
Because I like the cold and   
The smell of fireplace hickory   
and plastic soup in a plastic bowl   
which is all quite lucky   
for a police state.
