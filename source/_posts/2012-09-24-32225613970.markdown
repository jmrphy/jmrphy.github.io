I don't see why it's reasonable for people to look down on how we live, I mean, I think their nice apartments are truly sad and disgusting but I don't look down on them. I just don't care about them so I don't go to their houses and yea I laugh at them but if I don't look down on them then surely they have no right to look down on us.
