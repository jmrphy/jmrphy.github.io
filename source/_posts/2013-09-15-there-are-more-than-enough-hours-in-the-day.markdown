The popular refrain that "there aren't enough hours in the day" is an interesting departure from the long and storied political and rhetorical battle to *objectively* decrease the hours of the working day. It is an extraordinary gauge of our political pacification that when so many people have such a hard time meeting a pervasive social and economic expectation, we would sooner *ask for an extension* of the expectation than its abolition.
