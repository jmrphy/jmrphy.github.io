Most people are sensitive in their relations with loved ones but insensitive to the far greater suffering of others. This is disastrous for the loved ones as well as humanity in general. The real challenge for loved ones must be to treat each other with loving *insensitivity*, a mutual respect so deep that it is impossible to silently indulge the other’s flaws and weaknesses. This is not only a truer and more mutually empowering path for the loved ones, but perhaps even more importantly, it reserves one’s limited resources of sensitivity for maintaining the highest possible degree of awareness and protest toward the rest of the world’s deepest and most urgent varieties of human suffering.
