<h2>&ndash; life</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s reasonable for people to look down on how we live, I mean, I think their nice apartments are truly sad and disgusting but I don&rsquo;t look down on them. I just don&rsquo;t care about them so I don&rsquo;t go to their houses and yea I laugh at them but if I don&rsquo;t look down on them then surely they have no right to look down on us.</p>
