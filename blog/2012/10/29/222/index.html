<p>Hurricane Sandy just hit. It&rsquo;s supposed to be the storm of the century. Only question is, Jacob says, which century? So everyone just took a bunch of Adderall and everyone is just fucking around, building shit, reading and writing and all kinds of idiotic shit. We have ice and bottled water and nonperishable food supplies but I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to do if the FiOS goes out.</p>
