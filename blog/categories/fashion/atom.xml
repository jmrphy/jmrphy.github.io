    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Ox just got a gnarly industrial-strength sewing machine so this week I decided to make my debut in fashion design.</p>

<p>Hat tip goes to <a href="http://rhls.com/about.html">Ruffeo Hearts Lil Snotty</a>, from whom I got the pattern <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGsQFjAA&amp;url=http://www.rhls.com/threadbanger/fannypack.pdf&amp;ei=iXnCT5KCFujG6AGeipSuCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyjzo-g5BE7flpB1rrY43PpfcfmA&amp;sig2=UJOrPRPgYAtdA_T6Q0gC4Q">here</a>. As a business their politics and aesthetics are not quite mine&mdash;ultimately they do seem to be selling the false freedoms of frivolity, nostalgia, and the possibility of an ethical life under contemporary capitalism&mdash;but as humans they seem pretty rad (anti-exploitation, &ldquo;anti-fashion&rdquo;, DIY, they closed down for May Day, etc.). Taking some liberties with the design and having neither a shred of experience nor skill in sewing, I feel like my version is sufficiently DIY-looking to at least signal a theoretical rejection of the status quo. Surveying my career as a fashion designer, I feel like my intention over the past six days or so has been to blend the prevailing hipster aesthetic with the, uh, &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; or something. I think by &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; I mean militant anticapitalist &ldquo;colors&rdquo; and &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; maybe.</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a fucking mess of goddam strings sticking out of every nook and crevice in the bloody thing but I feel like that is just my signature style as a fashion designer. Everything I make will just have a million goddamn strings sticking out of every bloody fold and cranny, not on purpose but because that&rsquo;s just my style or something, i.e. what happened this time and will probably keep happening because I feel no desire to learn how to avoid that happening. I can&rsquo;t believe sewing works considering it&rsquo;s just a million little idiotic strings going every which way. Of course that works, so obvious.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made of standard canvas from a bookbag, which I lined with vinyl to make it uh, possibly water resistant. Incidentally, the vinyl came from the Occupy Philly May Day &ldquo;STRIKE&rdquo; banner! It has belt loops in the back to string my belt through. I added a little D-ring, why? Fuck if I know!l Looks useful, why the fuck not? So easy, should have added a goddamn can opener while I was at it. I also threw in a few pencil holders, a little pouch on the inside, and a red square for the historically unprecedented, spontaneous, indefinite <em>manifestations</em> of hundreds of thousands of Québécois underway right now.</p>
