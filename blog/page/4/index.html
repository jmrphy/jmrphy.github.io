		<p>In the Golden Age of ancient Greece, the elite cultivated an intellectual and political disalienation which today we can hardly fathom. But that was for a very small few whose leisure was directly and overwhelmingly based on the enslavement of others. At times I wonder if the magic of capitalist social relations is to effectively put a freeze on human freedom such that it only allows a constant quantity at any particular time; if you only give it to 500 people on the planet then they&rsquo;ll be really really free but when it is distributed to the masses (in order to expand and enhance the planet&rsquo;s labor power beyond chattel slavery), then everyone is only slightly free. What is interesting about capitalism is that the bourgeoisie so loves the pursuit of wealth that they have enslaved themselves, working extraordinarily long hours and obsessively doing the increasingly hard work of making capitalism hang together. The more people working in a given society, the rich included, the more freedom there is to be had by those who produce and reproduce life outside of commodified work. It is therefore an inherently revolutionary tendency that the most powerful individuals of the status quo are perpetually exhausting and blinding themselves by their own overworking&hellip;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>To take these introductory comments seriously is to unlock a whole new orientation for scientific research never before accessed by serious institutionalized scientific disciplines, especially the currently prevailing sciences of society. This present work is in no sense “interdisciplinary.” Rather, it is militantly anti-disciplinary, anti-_discipline _for that matter, and by scientific necessity. Moreover, what is at stake in this pursuit is a practical project of reconstituting that chain of speech, truth, and being—a chain of which Socrates is perhaps only the purest representative—which is the key to the history and fall of critical thought. Consequently, this work cannot be anything other than a gift in the strict sense, an expenditure without reserve, in friendship with the friendless, and an opening salvo against all the intellectual moneychangers, against all false friends everywhere. As such, it is also a call to philosophic and scientific arms, directed first and foremost to my peers, the young and privileged and educated, we who still have a choice between producing false truths to earn petty comforts in a thoroughly false society, or defecting in favor of a radically emancipated honesty absolutely opposed to every currently existing institution. Needless to say, the latter course won’t pay because it is strictly priceless or, what is the same, _worthless_. The only personal rewards we can expect are the clarity and dignity of poverty, and if we make it, an actual intellectual community. It’s happened once or twice before. But it is only by betraying the betrayers that we might one day soon meet on such a plane of new beginnings, the plane of honest philosophy and honest science.</p>

title: Do inflation expectations have an effect on Obama&rsquo;s re-election prospects?
wordpress_id: 301

<h2>&ndash; social science</h2>

<p><a href="http://redonkulusblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/could-fed-save-obama.html">Redonkulus Blog thinks so</a> based on some time-series data. But I was skeptical about this conclusions because I have just enough experience with time series to know that these sorts of inferences are really tricky. After checking out the data, I don&rsquo;t think there is a systematic relationship between inflation expectations and Obama&rsquo;s re-election prospects. For an overview of the measures, just visit the link above&hellip; I only want to share some analyses and review what&rsquo;s methodologically at stake here.</p>

<p>In short, the problem with time-series data is that it&rsquo;s often autocorrelated&mdash;for instance, an observation at time T-1 has a very strong effect on that variable at time T. When regressing a time series on another time series, it&rsquo;s easy to identify statistically significant relationships where no such thing exists if one variable is driving itself while another variable is just going along for the ride over time.</p>

<p>In regression analysis, the easiest way to check against spurious relationships is to analyze the residuals of the model. In particular, a plot of the model residuals against fitted values should be random with no identifiable pattern&mdash;if there are identifiable patterns than the model probably violated assumptions and is no good.</p>

<p>All of the Redonkulus regressions show residuals that suggest problematic models. I&rsquo;ll focus only on the inflation expectations model because that&rsquo;s what piqued some twitter interest heh.</p>

<p>Here are graphs of the model relating inflation expectations to Obama&rsquo;s Intrade scores. We see a pretty systematic pattern in the residuals by fitted values plot, suggesting violations of the OLS assumptions.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflationresiduals.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflationresiduals.png" alt="" /></a>One simple way to deal with this is to transform the time series in a way that filters out the autoregression. One way to do that is to use first differences instead of simple levels. Intuitively, this is perhaps more attractive, anyway: If we think X causes Y, then really we should think that a change in X will be associated with a change in Y&mdash;not just that when one is high the other is high.</p>

<p>Differencing and then re-running the model gives pretty clean, white-noise-ish residuals. But the relationship is not statistically significant.</p>

<p><strong>                                       Estimate    Std. Error    t value    Pr(>|t|)</strong>
(Intercept)                    0.313765      0.164460         1.908      0.0593
D.inflex                         -0.986283   2.377463         -0.415      0.6791
obama$Time<a href="">-105</a>     -0.005026   0.002742        -1.833      0.0698</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/diffinflationresiduals1.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/diffinflationresiduals1.png" alt="" /></a>And I basically find the same thing for the other models&mdash;residuals show violation of OLS assumptions; models using first differences are statistically insignificant but the residuals look pretty clean. I even tried lags on the independent variables, thinking maybe changes in inflation expectations might just take a day to show up in Obama&rsquo;s Intrade chances&mdash;but no, nothing. A scatterplot using levels and then a scatterplot using first differences sums this up.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflscatter.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflscatter.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In summary, I don&rsquo;t think this data offers evidence that monetary expansion would help Obama&rsquo;s chances of re-election. All of my R code follows, email me or Redonkulous if you want the data file.</p>

title: &lsquo;#16: Equilibrium and equality&rsquo;
wordpress_id: 45
categories:</p>

<h2>&ndash; theory</h2>

<p>“Whatever needs to be maintained through force is doomed.” – Henry Miller</p>

<p>The political implications at this point in our exposition are an almost absurd combination of obvious and radical. The most important implication of the present framework is that it unites the aim of social science (demonstrable causal explanations of empirical phenomena) with the aim of political philosophy (demonstrable explanations of what is good or just). This is because everything indicates that the concept of equilibrium in scientific modeling has more than an etymological commonality with the concept of <em>equality</em> in political philosophy. The philosophical value of equality has little to do with any historical state of nature, any original situation, or any traditionally positive, “true” philosophy of human nature whatsoever. As we have demonstrated, humanity and its history could not have emerged from anything but some flux of random inorganic inequality in a cosmic version of what social scientists would call “short-run” disequilibrium. Rather, equality is an absolute ontological <em>tendency</em> of all things—the nature of things <em>in the long run.</em> When a theorist as honest as Rousseau finds a justificatory key for the philosophical defense of human equality in a “state of nature,” it is not that he’s wrong; he only fails to specify the exact character of this theoretical finding. The state of nature is not where humans or anything else came from but where humanity and all things return after all the false, contingent, institutional props are removed. Given our methodological reliance on circularity as the structure of existence, it’s easy to see there is hardly any difference between where everything comes from and where all things return. The very point is that the definition of existence over time is <em>going back to where it came, _the “it” being nothing more than the negative space between going and returning. Rousseau’s path is very much our own, so long as we insist on the caveat that the original state of nature only _becomes</em> the true human origin as the <em>destination</em> of all honest human thought and action.</p>

<p>The path we have taken establishes human equality not first and foremost as a moral or ethical value to be debated indefinitely—as traditional, institutionalized philosophy has always done—but as a necessary condition for philosophy and science itself. Because even the bourgeois conception of truth is unconditionally inconsistent with bias, and we have shown that any intellectual movement other than pure Socratic negativity is biased in any institutionalized status quo, nothing that wants to be truly true, philosophically or scientifically, can even proceed in the absence of absolute equality between all things, human or otherwise.</p>

<p>For now, it suffices to say that honesty is a project of mapping all things as fully as possible. However, no cute Borgesian tales on the aporias of infinity are required to see that even the fullest possible map of how things function will be unable to include itself on the map. This would only function as an objection to our project if we were asking for permission to play on the plane of truth. Rather, we are on the plane of immanence, the plane of honesty, at the truth of truth, where we neither ask nor give permission. So long as we hold fast to honesty rather than truth, all these bad infinities can be shaken off like a bad dream. Honesty, as we will continue to elaborate it and as we must begin to practice it, is a project that takes the perverse circularity of mere truth as the springboard for honestly unraveling all things everywhere, all texts, obviously, but also all institutions, all milieus, all status quo stabilities at all junctures. This is how the philosopher of today must learn to see all of life as so many layered and interconnected facades that a simple but radical honesty cannot help but performatively bring into relief as absolutely and essentially false.</p>

<p> Barely lifting the lid on things, it is already possible to see how much idiocy we are capable of explaining with one critical method. For instance, how the refrain of “I’m just being honest” is often so dishonest given that society itself is only a systematic funhouse of smoke and mirrors. This popular apology often serves to justify dishonest speech or action by referring to objective reference points as if they were reference points of the true or “real,” whereas it is perfectly clear that “objective” reference points are perfectly arbitrary rest-stops on what is nothing more than a path of routinized contingency. As Henry Miller puts it, “One can be absolutely truthful and sincere even though admittedly the most outrageous liar. Fiction and invention are of the very fabric of life.” The chief characteristic and undeniable value of a corpus such as Miller’s, this mad dreaming of an auto-didacticic Brooklyn boy, is only his refusal to be “true” within the falsity of an American twentieth-century.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if most people don’t become great artists or philosophers, is it not because they possess <em>too much</em> fidelity to the truth? We fail to achieve our glory for being too good, too decent, too truthful. Decent folks see intellectual aporia at the very outset of thought more clearly than intellectuals; they correctly determine that their painting or story or treatise will be unjustifiably partial, somehow, vaguely untrue, inauthentic somehow. So they don’t bother. For the most part, today’s artists and intellectuals are those who, at a sufficiently young age in life, decided they didn’t give a damn about the truth; but that they would seek it nonetheless, if only to spite it.</p>

title: &lsquo;#15: The institutionalization of philosophy as the repression of honesty&rsquo;
wordpress_id: 46
categories:</p>

<h2>&ndash; theory</h2>

<p>It will be noticed that although we determine Truth and truth to be two false, ideological notions, we have opposed to these the third term of <em>honesty.</em> Honesty is human drive in full transparency, which manifests itself as the absolute and outright rejection of all currently existing things. In short, this is because all ensembles are only stabilized contingencies historically leveraged. The human drive, making no assumptions and having no reason to take anything for granted, quickly identifies the baselessness of all currently existing things. We all learn this when, after asking “Why?” three or four times in succession, mommy and daddy tell us to shut up if we want to eat dinner. If honesty acknowledges the legitimacy of nothing other than its own movement, it thus rejects all distinctions, and thus all that is left is the “oneness” of all human drive as ether or vapor or “event” at the edge of any moment in history.</p>

<p>The destination of honesty is thus the ground zero of nothingness, where the movement of skepticism—ineradicable in the history of philosophy—always lands. It is also the plane from which all things are spun, the plane of immanence. The motif of circularity announces itself once again. Because all things, from the atom to “human civilization,” by definition share the same structure of thinghood—but variably separated and distinguished by almost infinite and infinitely diverse evolutionary distributions—it is no surprise that human thought itself has the structure of a thing and that its true conclusions must return to its beginnings: absolute ignorance, and thus the indistinction of all existing things. The absolute indistinction of all existing things clearly implies the illegitimacy of all enforced separations.</p>

<p>Curiously, however, at the same time it serves an especially convenient springboard or foundation for making new things. Precisely because one can show, without fail, that the consistency and separation of anything collapses under scrutiny—this radically pervasive illegitimacy of contingent distinctions in our human world can be mobilized as an all the more convincing justification for some new premise in some now syllogism. As Deleuze and Guattari point out, Descartes’ proof of the cogito, one of the greatest philosophical innovation-thing of the modern period, finds its foundational certitude in the figure of an idiot who thinks and speaks to himself, doubting whether anything exists, including himself. It is easy to see that Husserl—by investing the strong skepticism of modern psychologism into a structure of an all-the-stronger transcendental consciousness, literally and rather transparently does this over again, doing for the idiot of modernism what Descartes does for the idiot of modernity.</p>

<p>This nexus that is at once the destination of honest thought and the source of dishonest but “true” thought is exactly what has been defined as the plain of immanence. As already defined, human thought is the eternal departure and return from and to the plain of immanence.</p>

<p>But the present investigation, by beginning with neither skeptical questioning nor the search for certitude, but existence in general as modeling the movement between the two, now furnishes a particularly stunning comment on the history of philosophy. Our investigation shows that the history of philosophy as an institution cannot help but suffer irredeemably and unjustifiably from a concrete and specifiable bias, and thus a component of systematic <em>falsity</em>. With respect to “truth,” skepticism and antiskepticism are perfectly undecidable. They are two perfectly equivalent things (philosophies) within one institutional ensemble (Philosophy), two equal and opposing movements that balance and constitute each other. This is not only why interpreters with opposite agendas can very well find either component in any particular philosopher. More importantly, it is why philosophy, so long as it refers us to criteria related to “truth”—logic, reason, whatever—suffers from what social scientists call “status quo bias.”</p>

<p>In short, truth is a bribed referee because a tie between the absolute critique of currently existing institutions and the absolute defense of all currently existing institutions will always be decided in favor of the latter, in favor of currently existing institutions. The institutionalization of philosophy is exactly this bribe, society literally paying the radically honest with the right to live and often the right to live comfortably, on condition that they commit to being merely truthful. Was this not exactly the provisional solution of Platonism and the Academy as a response to the crisis of Socrates? And history shows that when such bribed referees depart from the merely true to the honest, their right to live is revoked in proportion to this departure. Some are given hemlock or burned at the stake, others sent from their post at Yale to the University of London.</p>

<p>This also returns us to the alternative metaphorical registers of physics and evolution. We are simply pointing out that in the institution of philosophy, any conceptual innovation—skeptical or antiskeptical—is subject to the laws of “attraction” or “selection.” Skepticism falls to the earth neither more nor less than antiskepticism, but the ideological falsity of the debate lies precisely in the fact that between these two opponents the earth itself was supposed to be at stake! An unbiased, non-ideological social context for philosophy would imply literally earth-shaking, society-wide alterations of human experience during the highwater marks of skepticism and equally strong returns to stability during the highwater marks of antiskepticism. That only a small portion of society experience only minor alterations of perception at any of these junctures, relative to the always-overwhelming gradualism of dynamics in common sense, illustrates how far we are from the seemingly absurd implications of an unbiased social context for philosophy. Similarly, skepticism is neither more nor less “fit” than anti-skepticism, given the institutional context of philosophy, and faces neither more nor less selection pressures. But honesty evolved into “truth” because of selection pressures, selection pressures that are perfectly contingent and unjustified sanctions in favor of the status quo.</p>

<p>By accepting truth as a criterion, honesty pays homage to falsity by marketing itself as a merely true “skepticism,” thus becoming harmless, perfectly balanced and neutralized by an equally true antiskepticism. But in doing so it also becomes essentially dishonest. This is how philosophy as an institution—captured in our running cartoon starring Socrates and Plato—betrays its original impulse, and indeed how institutionalization as such is nothing less betrayal as pure form. Incidentally, this accounts for why the notion of betrayal is loaded with such a fundamental contradiction as that between “showing possession,” and “turning one’s back on.” It is because to earn a socially legitimated ownership of something is strictly tantamount to turning it upside down, submitting it to the ideological inversion that society requires so as to not let any radically honest claim destroy its dishonest essence and foundation.</p>

title: &lsquo;#14: Socratic honesty and Platonic betrayal&rsquo;
wordpress_id: 47
categories:</p>

<h2>&ndash; theory</h2>

<p>The chief difficulty of logic stems from the ideological nature of language. Dealing only with truth, with internal consistency, logic models the essence of the thing but not its existence. Its existence can only be modeled by the whole map of it, which means not the image of an air-tight circle floating in space, but a map of the whole ensemble within which it is constituted and constituting and including the word-things of its negative space. This is to say that, pretty obviously, logic has the <em>structure</em> of a fiction. Without any sanction from Truth, logic draws maps that are true and thus ideological. If Socrates is special because he testifies to <em>nothing</em> and is thus made to disappear (he is exceedingly massive or evolutionarily unfit relative to the whole ensemble), analytical philosophy is special because its formalism testifies to _everything, _i.e. anything one feels like putting in the place of all those _P_s and _Q_s. This first of all serves as an excellent illustration of the difference between honest, radical philosophy and bourgeois, collaborationist philosophy: the difference between producing things in the service of truth as opposed to producing truth in the service of things.</p>

<p>But second of all, conceptualizing the difference between Socratic and analytic philosophy in this manner, is an extremely provocative way to cap on both ends the history of what is called Western civilization. In the figure of Socrates, this history begins with an explosion of intellectual energy the unlimited and relentless nature of which obviously threatened the whole ensemble of falsely constituted “things” on whose backs the Greek polis rose to such clarity. As soon as the radical <strong>honesty</strong> represented by Socrates is betrayed by a Plato, whose endlessly provocative, stimulating, and subversive negotiations with Socrates’ executioners are, nonetheless for all of that, <em>negotiations with executioners</em>. When a teacher gets murdered for being honest and the indignant student’s response is to start an Academy, the jig is up. Everything is in place for that peculiar ensemble of institutions that prides itself on producing so much truth and beauty at the cost of so much dishonesty, murder, slavery and exploitation across the earth. After the Academy, it is not long until we get Aristotle, the syllogism and a thousand and one additional betrayals of the Platonic vision, itself already a betrayal. From there, Western civilization is nothing more than a little bit of primitive accumulation, a few false starts, and then finally the society-wide institutionalization of betrayal: what is called capitalism. Today, lo and behold, at the world-historical height of global capitalism, the discipline of philosophy is dominated by analytical philosophy, where everything that currently exists is true.</p>

<p>Arguably, Plato’s philosophy can be read as an effort to establish and protect a space for radical honesty. Immediately, this would be the function of the Academy. In the longer term, Plato would have radical honesty installed, via the philosopher-king, in the seat of political power itself. So it is not a matter of indicting Plato, for we are all guilty, dwelling in his place halfway between Truth and murder; the point is to see how and why anything other than absolute and revolutionary honesty is betrayal. If philosophy wishes to be anything, it must be a radical honesty that seeks to accelerate all existing things into itself, testifying to the truth of nothing currently existing, effectively chewing up everything in order to make some new ensemble of things; otherwise, it is nothing apart from commerce, just another form of dishonesty and collaboration with all of the past, present, and future horrors taking place across the globe.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>By arriving at ideology and false consciousness, we thereby arrive at the question of truth, a question the history of philosophy has quite impressively muddled up with repressed nervous energy, as we will show.</p>

<p>If we understand Truth to be “that which really is the case” beyond contingent and arbitrary appearances, it becomes perfectly clear according to our model that in some sense, _there is only falsity. _That is, the generation and persistence of things, including maps or ensembles of word-things, cannot escape determination by arbitrary distributions of things across ensembles possessing no other positive sanction than a persistence into which, strictly speaking, they randomly stumbled at every stage. All things are false because every existing thing is only a component in a durable ensemble of things spun from some unknown and unknowable contingent point of a strictly random flux. Of course, all language is equally false because word-things are no more endorsed by anything other than similarly multi-staged but random persistances.</p>

<p>In fact, if what we want from our maps of existence is the map of that which “really” is the case beyond contingent and arbitrary appearances, we must run as fast as we can away from all inherited language, even if we will have no choice but to loop back into it for the purpose of making any sense or having a human audience. For, as we have shown, language from the beginning is not just raised and nurtured throughout every stage of its life by an arbitrary distribution of things, but that the most evolutionarily-fit formations of language—true statements, in other words—will be those that strengthen, flatter, confirm, integrate, i.e. accelerate back toward the ensemble that randomly emits the energy constituting them. Thus, if we are interested in what is “really” the case, almost all language at any point in time is interesting mostly as an index of what is not the case at all. Just as contracts do not represent trust, but testify to a lack of trust. Just as a philosophical “system” does not represent the integrity of a philospher’s thought but testifies precisely to the insufficiency of integrity freely developed. Language, similarly, has never had and could never have the function of capturing or reflecting that which “really” is, but rather it testifies only to that which <em>is</em> fictionally. If language testified to what really is, it would testify to nothing (as in the language of Socrates) and be killed off (as in the fate of Socrates).</p>

<p>However, as we could not help but observe in passing, there certainly seems to exist such a thing as true statements. So long as we understand what is meant by deploying a small <em>t</em>, then of course, truth exists. The thing called truth is best represented in logic. It is a closed system that internally coheres, the syllogism. So long as premises are stated, we can deduce from them implications that are formally, strictly, truly true.</p>

<p>But of course, it is obvious and well-known that the formal truth of logic says nothing of the content of the premises. In other words, the philosophical discipline known as logic—just like evolutionary theory, physics, electrical analysis, and any other discipline we will continue to exhume insofar our investigation continues to both justify and demand it—is just another metaphor for the structure of things, ideologically inflected by its own place in the division of intellectual labor. What is the syllogism other than a closed loop that, as pure form, consists by design in no-_thing_ other than a beginning (major premise) that extends itself (minor premise) only to loop back into itself (conclusion)?</p>

wordpress_id: 51

<h2>&ndash; theory</h2>

<p>When it draws a picture of itself on the wall, as buffalo becoming human, it represents one of many distributions of investment possible for the caveman. He is reflecting in <em>leisure time,</em> an intensive good itself only produced by the physical labor of finding and walking into the cave. He simply continues to draw the map of his world, the next lines on the same map he drew across the earth in his footsteps to the cave. But because the lines of snow have been neutralized, effectively erased by the cave as a dwelling, it becomes possible to draw not simply the most simple and urgent maps, of the animal and snow and cave, but rather it is then possible to draw a map of the animal and snow and cave drawing a map. This is done via the plane of immanence with the cave’s wall as canvas. But notice that this artistic abstraction in leisure is not idle play, it is simply the next logical step of human nature as intensive space. For, the most evolutionarily valuable map is always the fullest map, which means the map of all things, including all maps, and so on and so forth. The difficult implication is that the one absolute map is impossible, and the quantitatively greatest map is in no way necessarily the second best. This is because maps, as things, can also be used to produce things. All of this is simply to reveal the inherent openness of evolutionary development as non-teleological and that maps are never just maps but functions. Any map, as a thing, can be used to produce other things.</p>

<p>Thus, the arts and sciences converge as the work of constructing maps of intensive things via the plane of immanence onto which the human is always falling back to gravitationally, using extensive things as models in leisure. In other words, nothing more or less than non-, extra-, anti-, sub, or supra-institutional human life.</p>

<p>Note the true character of art and science with respect to our growing portfolio of unified theories. First of all, clearly, authentic art and science represent defaults without reservation on all debts owed to existence, in order to invest in the production of new models. They are the apples thrown sufficiently high that they reach their own orbit, leaving the original ensemble or force-field which generated them, despite its gravity. They are random mutations—like language—that are in many ways unfit with respect to the prevailing ensemble but create niches in which new traits might thrive despite the dominant ensemble of things and potentially threatening the extinction of that dominant ensemble. Art and science are both illegitimate or_ corrupt<em>, to use a classical term reanimated in some degree by Hardt and Negri, exactly to the degree they pay back the dominant ensemble. If they do not take their own prerogatives absolutely, if they pay for permission in the coin of _homage</em>, they are neither art nor science. The arts and sciences, if they are to be anything, must be everything. Needless to say, they are currently nothing.</p>

title: Untitled play about maybe getting rid of a bed
wordpress_id: 52
categories:</p>

<h2>&ndash; collaboration</h2>

<p>With <a href="http://thebreadfromonesownmouth.tumblr.com">The Bread From One&rsquo;s Own Mouth</a>.</p>

<p>* 
<em>XX &amp; XY in bed, lying. Both moderately tall, attractive moderately dark-haired people, roughly 22-26 years old. </em></p>

<p><em>Enter Z, a moderately tall, attractive dark-haired man, roughly 26-years old. He walks to the foot of the bed.</em></p>

<p>Z: Why are you in this bed?</p>

<p>XY sits up.</p>

<p>XY: Good question, I really have no idea. (to no one) Why do we even have it?</p>

<p>XX: (to Z) Why are you in this room? Fuck you.</p>

<p>Z: What!? Why wouldn’t I be? It’s so easy!</p>

<p>XX: (sits up, smiling suddenly) Oh yeah, it’s so obvious! We should just get rid of the bed!</p>

<p>XY: We should definitely get rid of it right now. It’s so obvious.</p>

<p>XX: It’s so easy.</p>

<p>XY: Okay, great. Let’s get rid of it right now.</p>

<p>XX: What should we do with it? (lays back down, solemnly) I hate this bed. I just want to get it out of here. This bed does nothing for me.</p>

<p>XY: It’s so obvious. Let’s just put it on the roof. Then we wouldn’t even have to see it!</p>

<p>XX: But what about when we go on the roof? Then there’d be this dumb bed just staring at us. And when we’re not on the roof, I feel like we’d feel it’s presence coming through the ceiling or something. No, we can’t put it on the roof.</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, there is no reason to do that. That would be the dumbest thing.</p>

<p>XX: Let’s just put a really hard surface on top of the bed. Let’s negate the bedness of the bed.</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, it’s so obvious! Wait, no it’s not. It’d be so hard to find a hard surface.</p>

<p>XX: Yeah, that’d be such a pain in the ass. Granite weighs so much. It’s so stupid.</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, it’s so obvious! Let’s just move out.</p>

<p>XX: Like, abandon the bed? Yeah, that is definitely so obvious!</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, it would be so easy to leave right now. You can basically leave anywhere you want at any time.</p>

<p>XX: But I never want to see a bed ever again. There are going to be beds anywhere we go. I want to completely escape the bed as both a physical object and as a paradigm of bourgeois comfort and pacification.</p>

<p>XY: Really? Are there beds everywhere? I feel like there are never any beds anywhere. Just awake bourgeois people.</p>

<p>XX: Where is a place where there are no beds and no bourgeois people? Let’s go there. It’s so obvious.</p>

<p>XY: I feel like the bed idea is just an excuse to express and present ourselves and to also spend time together doing something “productive,” I think it’s sad we need the bed for that, so we should burn it to prove we don’t need it to write a play.</p>

<p>XY: Feel like “burning the bed” has been a funny/cool idea but just now got a really strong flash of a feeling that I think if you agreed I would maybe literally, really truly light it on fire in my room and maybe burn the house down accidentally. Really, actually felt for one second that I would definitely do that.</p>

<p>XX: Into burning the bed, turning it into an effigy to all the shit that we do not need, the feeling of ‘doing it anyway’ in the face of perhaps not immediately being able to. Re: the bed, we do not need it for the things that we do. Let’s burn it. Really, truly, let’s burn this goddamn bed.</p>

<p>XX: ALSO
I AM FUCKING AMPED UP ON JUICE AND ADDERALL
IS THIS HOW GOD FEELS??????????</p>

<p>XX: I FEEL LIKE APHRODITE AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IS MY BOW</p>

<p>XY: I think I have 6 Word documents open, all of which I just started. I am so glad you are not in my room, but I am so glad that you are alive. I am so glad that you are a breathing, pulsing, desiring, knowing and unknowing being who is not in my room this minute but is aliving.</p>

<p>XX: I think the number of tabs I have open on my computer is directly related to the number of drugs I have taken that day.</p>

<p>XY: I feel like, uh, the little pink block with your name in it is a symbol of your, uh, heart beating.</p>

<p>XX: That’s because it is. We got to know each other as pixels, after all. Although my heart is probably beating much faster than the little pink block. Because of the adderall.</p>

<p>XY: I think this is how rich people feel by default and that’s why they get rich. I’m really glad I’m not like this by default, but instead only get like this when I’m poor and so become rich only in feelings and ideas and non-monetized digital productivity.</p>

<p>XX: I feel like Jesus said something along those lines. Right? That our richness is not measured by how much money we have, etc etc. Jesus was so radical. Maybe this is why heart attacks are so prevalent amongst businesspeople. Their hearts are beating this fast all the fucking time!</p>

<p>XY: Yea and amphetamines make people talk past each other full speed ahead—which we are even kind of doing right now, but which is totally OK because I know you genuinely care about my thoughts and feelings, you’re just overflowing with your own and I want you to do that. And I want to do that too, although I just wanted to register that a certain frantic, selfish insensitivity to the ideas or thoughts of others is possessing me right now. Like we are two really really fast speedboats zooming around a lake right now, which is OK and really fun but you also still make me so tender and I just want to register that. Uh, ok, I’m just going to keep going.</p>

<p>We had a couchsurfer from France once, he was an art history PhD student, actually, I’m glad you weren’t here because he was very handsome and I would have felt scared because I’m still a little boy probably—but he told me something that I really appreciated, and that I think in my life plan I am going to really, really sort of double-down on. His dissertation focused on American Pop Art and he said the truth is that Andy Warhol only gets so much credit for the very simple and mundane fact that he archived things better than anyone else at the time. That it’s really only about keeping good records, leaving behind a lot. Kind of like what I talk about when I talk about intensity as the only thing that matters, if you just do every single thing and record it then you’re a world historical genius. So easy. Feel like we should only ever write to each other on one Google Word Doc for the rest of our lives. We could maybe, truly, literally, write the most epic, uh, I wanna say “love letter” but you know, not trying to pack too much into that lol, just like, as a genre or something.</p>

<p>XX: Listen —</p>

<p>XX: Free bird —</p>

<p>XX: You are a fucking free fucking bird and so am I and we should like, fly around together but totally stick to own trajectories. And when we intersect, on occasion, it’ll be a cool thing and we can catch each other up on our flights.</p>

<p>XX: I like the idea of legacy but I find it unsatisfactory. Perhaps patriarchal. Because my legacy will be and already is intricately connected to the people around me, shit is relational, it is constituted by others, which is why I like what we are doing, simultaneously, constituting this relationship &amp; each other’s legacies in the process. I am going to go smoke a cigarette and maybe inhale deeply and slowly, but I am glad that you are out there somewhere &ndash; &ndash; not just somewhere, but somewhere that I have been, which is fucking cool, that we have occupied the same spaces for once in our fucking lives &ndash; &ndash;</p>

<p>XX: fly free, bird.</p>

<p>XY: Maybe good point about the desire for legacy being patriarchal. Yea, I think that’s right. It’s narcissistic and really a desire to dominate. I’d say I only want to dominate the dominators, but I don’t know if that’s OK. In the opposite direction, after our conversation last night I feel very comfortable right now sharing the silliest little micro-insecurities, because I’m prepared to release all fear of being a pathetic mess of ugly nerve endings. So I just want to tell you that in your last paragraph the last two lines made me feel really sad, actually, not for too long or anything but they really kinda made me happiness and ecstatic energy sink low very suddenly because you used the past tense and the word “once.” Those last two lines make me scared you are going to leave me.</p>

<p>XY: Also feel like I want to intersect more than “on occasion,” maybe felt tiny sad when you wrote “occasion.” Feel like I intersect with my family “on occasion” and I don’t really ever want to hang out with them that much. These few things make me scared you are going to leave me, they really feel shitty and scary. Trying not to act tough.</p>

<p>XX: Don’t act tough, toughness is stupid. It’s so obvious. I’m scared you’re going to leave too &ndash; when I went outside to smoke I thought about how great all of this is but how absolutely terrifying. I keep telling people that I came here to fail, which I find kind of funny, but of course affirming the possibility of failure is very different than affirming the failure itself. But, for what it is worth, my heart is ‘soaring’ (more bird/flight imagery) when I think about what has happened &amp; will continue. I do find it interesting that I am choosing to use flight imagery, but less maybe to point out the leaving and maybe moreso to point to the ‘touching down.’ The taking a breath, which is a really important part of flying but isn’t really talked about, taking a rest and then, maybe most beautifully, the deep breath before the next take-off. With you I am taking breaths! It’s such a cool thing to share with someone. In any case, I feel super positive about you —- wow positive is such a silly word but I won’t delete it — and I am really excited/terrified.</p>

<p>XX: Also, you know, I feel insecure all of the time. And not in the sense that all the time I am in a state of insecurity, which is obviously not true, but that, you know, I carry them with me. They are like kids screaming on the back of a school bus, and I’m like the driver, and getting them to shut up is a lot harder than just arriving at a stop and making them get off.</p>

<p>XX: “Get off my bus, you punks.”</p>

<p>XX: &lt;3</p>

<p>XX: lol</p>

<p>XY: Aria can you just not use the past tense talking about me or us? Like, unless it’s past.</p>

<p>XX: okay. I won’t.</p>

<p>XX: I won’t. I am wont to want you.</p>

<p>XY: What scares me is that this sort of high speed stream of consciousness dialogue maybe reveals things we might not reveal consciously—so it’s sad you used the past tense. And diminutives such as “on occasion.” It’s ok, of course! It’s just that I feel more like I’m soaring and want to keep soaring and not really breathe or stop or intersect with you but just like we’re both soaring, so simple to me, so obvious and amazing heh.</p>

<p>XX: “WHAT HAS HAPPENED &amp; WILL CONTINUE.”</p>

<p>XX: You know, lovebirds got their name because they actually cannot psychologically exist without another around. A friend of mine had a single lovebird and one day it started puking up its food — in any case it created a little puke-statue dovebird that it hung out with. I don’t know why I bring this up except maybe to say that if you weren’t around I might make a puke statue to you. This is my way of showing affection, heh.</p>

<p>XY: I’m not worried about becoming attached like lovebirds, because I have been feeling exactly as happy when you are in my physical presence as when you’re not—and we’re both rad independent ambitious folks so i’m just not worried on that front. because i’m not worried on that front, i want to only use the fucking realest most courageous and scary but beautiful language toward you and with you and about you. i want to not be afraid to feel and say crazy shit that’s only real and big and awesome. and if it’s not intense then i don’t want to say feel or do it, or something. feel like that is how we are powerful, or how we can become the kind of powerful we have alluded to before, like i think that’s the only way we can take over the world—didn’t that come up, taking over the world or something?</p>

<p>XX: OK, another random micro-insecurity: things will not always be so intense, arent’ there lulls and landings and breaths in every relationship? What if it is not so intense anymore? Or for a while? Taking over the world did come up. I feel like I can do that w you.</p>

<p>XY: Exactament! Uh, I think you’re totally right of course that lulls and landings come up, for sure! But they’ll come whether we want them or not—so I guess I’d rather just formally declare war on them, anyway. Might as well. Like I don’t want to produce more of them then are necessary just because we know they’re inescapable—with you Aria I want to destroy all lulls, landings, bores, bourgeois, breaths, parties, hangouts, cheap talk, small talk, fluff flarther furthings and even fun—to hell with it all, I just want to be, like, real, and intense and insane and beautiful and truthful, and if you want to with me then I will try to do that so hard, yea.</p>

<p>XX: Destroy all parties. The only way we’ll get there I think is by being honest. After our conversation last night I similarly feel ready to really open up to you. I really want to do that with you, I want it so badly and I am prepared to put every bit of myself towards it. Like, really, I am, yes I say yes I will yes.</p>

<p>XX: Let’s burn the fucking bed.</p>

<p>XY: (Lights match.)</p>

<p>XX: (Pours….kerosene? Gas? Olive oil!)</p>

<p>XY: Fin?</p>

<p>XY: Go do something beautiful, yea? We can talk plenty later!</p>

<p>XX: Okay. you do the same. Meet u in the sky.</p>

<p>FIN.</p>

title: Dialogue on trying to live a revolutionary life
wordpress_id: 53
categories:</p>

<h2>&ndash; collaboration</h2>

<p>With <a href="http://thebreadfromonesownmouth.tumblr.com">The Bread From One’s Own Mouth</a>.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Barclay Shields: At a time when deeply ideological&mdash;and deeply conservative&mdash;ways of thinking and behaving have become so entrenched, when mechanisms of social control have become so pervasively solidified, the most truly revolutionary life might not even look political. That would be pretending we are still politicized subjects! In an era such as ours, a truly revolutionary life might not even dabble in what is thought of as radical politics, agitation, or organizing, practices which are themselves, especially in their ideologies (of self-sacrifice, discipline, instrumental calculation, personal profit, etc.) so much a function of contemporary bureaucratic capitalism&mdash;but might rather commit to creating a new effectively revolutionary subjectivity that fractures that inert base of contemporary depoliticization in order to once again make political organizing possible. But the specific dilemma I’d like to note is that the bureaucratic, capitalist contamination of contemporary activism and organizing quickly pounce on any freshly radicalized individual, sterilizing everything that is potently, contagiously revolutionary about all fresh converts&mdash;namely, naivete, zeal, impatience, intransigence, and that paradoxically fearless joyousness that always follows from properly lucid realizations of hopelessness. I think this explains my dissatisfaction with currently available forms of political activism and, not to mention, incidentally, feelings you and I have shared about the legitimately revolutionary significance of true love&mdash;how an absolutely committed, defiant, and public love between even two people could be provocatively disruptive if only all the commonly fascist baggage is successfully resisted.</p>

<p>The Bread From One’s Own Mouth: On this topic I certainly agree with much you have articulate to me, both in this current conversation and in those countless others we’ve entertained previously. On this topic I’ve been particularly occupied with the notion of newness, which appears as a foundational point of contact for Hannah Arendt. According to her, humans have the unique capacity for newness, which she calls &ldquo;natality.” Not only is natality humanity’s paramount achievement, it constitutes the primary condition for political engagement. This concept seems especially fitting now, not only as we both attempt to construct for ourselves a revolutionary life-looking, but also within this historical moment, in the shadow of Occupy, the Arab Spring, drone strikes, global capitalism. Although Occupy prompted mass action &ndash; indeed, in some sense it seemed to bring into being a new polis, or public/political space &ndash; it’s time of natality has clearly passed. This became particularly evident, or even inevitable, after the encampments were violently suppressed, which I believe is a major source of its current transition into the more conservative activism that you describe. The political actor no longer feels the vibrancy of this contemporary polis (I say contemporary polis because what was created during Occupy was not only a space for conversation and action, but the whole of human living &ndash; that is, alternative medicinal resources, safety, food, education, etc, which is obviously dramatically contrasted from the Greek polis). How does one construct a similar space of freedom when space is continually, relentlessly, ‘pounced on,’ as you put it, either stifled entirely or simply subsumed by the activist industrial complex? Perhaps more importantly to me, how does one construct such a space without leaving people behind &ndash; not inclusive in the sense of political representation, but one that incorporates friends, family, those against and with whom I constitute myself? Those who perhaps exist on a different political or social terrain than myself, but on whom my freedom is nonetheless contingent? Like my mother, for instance, a woman whose freedom I value as much as mine own, and yet who has vastly different ideas about life-living? My relationship with you, of course, is of a different matter entirely, as a love that is absolutely committed to revolutionary life &ndash; indeed, a love that has become one of the defining characteristics of it!</p>

<p>BS: Right, I think all of that is understandable and I’ve thought some of those things myself. But my fear is that in trying to share our own deeply cherished feelings, positions and visions with others who don’t share them but who might if only we could communicate them&mdash;my fear is that it might practically require such an attenuation of them that it effectively amounts to a betrayal of them. Their authentically lived qualities&mdash;the exuberance and joyously fearless overzealousness I mentioned before&mdash;always gets lost when “politicizing” others becomes the goal of some specific activity rather than the necessary social effect of exhibiting a life as emancipated as possible. In other words, it could be that in the attenuation of energies required even in the simple, specific activity of “sitting down to have a conversation” with one’s little brother or whoever it might be, we are already basically volunteering to omit precisely what is most irresistible and most convincing about our perspective! Namely, that it makes us stand and jump, run in the streets, yell at cops, demand higher wages, demand respect, act out against institutions infinitely more powerful than us, travel, write, cry, all happily, publicly, proudly. It’s precisely these things we fail to do when we go out of our way to organize the depoliticized or educate friends and family. We give them everything boring, unconvincing, and dismissable (“OK Justin, we get it, you’re the youthful idealist in the family, but nothing is ever going to change!” rather than what is irresistible and undeniable (“Uh, what country is Justin in? Ever since that Occupy stuff I haven’t seen or heard from him in years, but he’s always writing crazy shit on the internet… He’s in love, too, it seems? He doesn’t seem to work much or care about anything I care about, he never even pays his bills or debts! Hmm, maybe things are changing…”). In other words, I feel the same things you’ve communicated, but I actually think the best way to care about others is to have as little respect for the status quo as possible, even the status quo that exists inside of them. To love the status quo inside of someone is simply to hate them, sweetly. The best way I can love someone, and refuse to leave them behind, is to live as forwardly, radically, and defiantly as possible. To show them and anyone else who&rsquo;s paying any attention what can be won from fighting for a new subjectivity, something that I think is very much on the table for us, precisely because a radical political subjectivity hasn’t been widely on display or widely available for decades in this country. And finally, I think the difference between the original explosion of the Occupy movement and its sort of post-orgiastic “organizing” agenda currently is precisely this difference: that at first, it was exciting precisely because it heralded an emancipation of everyday life, but as soon as it degenerates back into the status quo of behaviors and practices available and unattractive for years, of course it has lost potency. I suppose it&rsquo;s precisely coming out of this experience that to me, now, the path forward is the selfish-sounding but I think politically and ethically defensible commitment to emancipating myself from the status quo intensely as possible, in order to legitimately become political force rather than trying to organize its absence.</p>

<p>TBFOOM: I think my question, though, is not concerned at all with diverging from a revolutionary life, which by this point both of us clearly and resolutely aspire to and for. However, such a potent decision must content with the absolute fact that such a life does not, purposefully does not, defiantly does not, fit into life itself. It is at once a rejection from life as we know it and the absolute affirmation of life, a new life, a world-building affirmation. And those that cannot bear to reject this life instead sacrifice themselves to it. Sacrifice, in fact, seems to dominate the activist ethos and the activist’s self-image. It strikes me as quite Christian in origin, inherited from martyr narratives. Coincidentally enough, “burning out” is a phrase used to describe the logical outcome of the activist’s sacrifice, which strikes me as superbly reminiscent of a martyr’s burning at the stake, but that is beside the point. It seems clear that the question is not one should prevent burnout, but rather, what is it about the current paradigm of activism that is lending itself to this idea of sacrifice? I would argue that the difficulty of committing to a revolutionary life can be found in its outright rejection of self-sacrifice, and why conversations concerning political activism always return to the boring binary between revolution and reform, both of which ultimately return to the concept of sacrifice: with reformism, that sacrifice takes place in the form of an agreement between the subjects in the state, wherein both agree or consent to the others’ demands. With revolution, that sacrifice is ideally or in theory more short-lived &ndash; and is made in exchange for the outcome of the revolution itself, whether that be equality, the distribution of wealth, death to the aristocracy, etc &ndash; but nevertheless still presents itself as an inevitable component of such. This is where anarchist theory really comes in handy, in that the most basic action to which subjects are called is to live an autonomous and self-sovereign life, a will-full life.</p>

<p>BS: Yeah, it&rsquo;s seems a sort of really insidiously conservative, ideological trap that to do organizing work seems to require the betrayal of precisely the lived reality of one&rsquo;s own desires&mdash;the meetings!&mdash;a betrayal of the sovereign, omnidirectional intransigence that radicalism implies. There is a sort of prohibition on what the radically emancipated fulfillment of one&rsquo;s desires actually looks like, precisely what could be perhaps the most revolutionary and sort of contagious activity, all in the name of trying to empower people who often suffer first and foremost from the forced depoliticization of their desire! It makes sense that contemporary capitalism will tolerate activist organizations so long as they prohibit their members from pursuing or spreading their own committed emancipation! &ldquo;Organizing,&rdquo; the very term, presupposes that the people to be organized are in fact political subjects. But what if the problem is precisely that we&rsquo;ve become so depoliticized that, on some level, we&rsquo;re not even political subjects? If this is the case, then most of what is called activism or organizing is not only going to be consistently and disappointingly unaffective, but it will also be&mdash;convenient for the status quo&mdash;actively repressive of the only activity privilege is good for, namely, unprofitable or we might say antiprofitable expenditures toward the creation of anticapitalist values, i.e. countercultures. And as if this is not convenient enough for the status quo, this particular distribution of priorities currently so common to Serious Radical Activists is reinforced even more by an often knee-jerk and tactically uncritical way of thinking and speaking about privilege. Specifically, we sort of police each other, in our shared disrespect for unfair privileges, into living and behaving conservatively rather than revealing and exhibiting precisely that to which it is such a travesty for us to have disproportionate access! Because we are aware of the injustice of our own privileges, we’ve developed an immobilizing neurosis around these privileges rather than using them to bite the hand the fed them to us. When we modestly “resist” our privileges, we think we are being educated, discipline radicals, but really we’re covering up the crimes of a capitalist distribution. We ought to use our privileges openly and provocatively, living freely and immodestly, irresistibly and politically, not only because we deserve freedom as much as anyone, but exactly in order to politicize a desire for them among those who ought to be up-in-arms for having been deprived them!</p>

<p>TBFOOM: I agree that one cannot simply hope to negate one’s privileges, as they are built on material borders, injustices, and inequalities, but instead one must try to enliven them to their own destruction, so to speak. Along those lines, in questioning the political capacity of the contemporary subject, I am reminded of much of the radical and critical theory written in the past 50 years or so, particularly Judith Butler&rsquo;s work, which sets out to do exactly that: to problematize the subject. I do not think it’s a coincidence that theory is commonly conceived of as, if not the complement to praxis, it’s apolitical antithesis! The oft-exaggerated binary between theory and practice goes hand-in-hand with the outright aggression towards academics, philosophers, and more generally thinkers, which has been increasing over the past 60 or 70 years. What’s happening is a widespread and systematic repression of thinking itself. Yes, thinking, what a seemingly silly concept but one that is dangerously real nonetheless. Not only can we no longer trust in the existence of a subject equipped for politics, we can no longer taking for granted that there is a politics towards which subjects can turn to at all. There needs first to be the possibility of politics to occur. This is why I find that much political philosophy is no longer useful, despite it’s long tradition that began, arguably, with Plato. The question that needs to be asked now is not what one’s utopian model of democracy looks like, and then setting about to cast subjects towards this model, but instead questioning the very possibility of politics &ndash; and a political subject &ndash; entirely.</p>
