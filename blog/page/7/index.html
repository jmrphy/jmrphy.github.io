  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I understand him correctly, musician and theorist John Maus argues that the way of listening called music can be brought forth universally through the core procedure of pop, which, to him, is the process of abstracting away from music all “concentrations” or particularities of its contingent production and enjoyment (namely, standardization, materialization, and multiplication).</p>

<p>According to Maus, the pop musicians R. Stevie Moore and Ariel Pink represent a tradition of pop music that approaches the singular truth of pop through an excessive enactment of its protocols. For instance, R. Stevie Moore’s song “You are True” is “too much a pop song,” representing an excess that commercial capitalism cannot integrate.</p>

<p>The identification and elaboration of a subversive current in the pop tradition is exciting and probably true, but the recent celebration of Maus and the so-called truth of pop hides an elephant on the other side of pop-music’s very large room. Namely, what is the profane truth of commerically successful mainstream pop music, capable of producing in the masses a sometimes ecstatic or almost religious satisfaction but specifically not excessive, not distruptive?</p>

<p>If Maus is interested in what we might call the <em>ecstatic</em> or <em>sacred</em> truth of pop, then the <em>profane</em> truth of pop music is its paradoxical serenity, which is peculiarly capable of immobilizing and inuring the listener at the same time that within the context of present social conditions and contemporary “post-political” ideology it tends to produce only one specific desire other than for the eternal recurrence of the song itself: for the commodity, the saleable good or service that will be provided to the buyer granted the buyer has enough money, i.e. the only human lack that pop-music seems capable of not completely obfuscating or concealing in the name of our contented enjoyment. The wedding of modern advertising and pop music is only the most obvious example of the marked ideological consistency between pop music and the fetishism of commodities. I would just like to bear out these claims. I begin with an anecdote.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Sitting in a café, having just finished a cup of coffee, I read the following sentence from Rachel Annand Taylor’s Leonardo the Florentine: “Among his flowering perfections there creeps that suggestion not only of the bizarre but of the monstrous. At one or two disconcerting moments one feels that Leonardo, indifferent at heart as the “Nature” of his devotion, is, like her, capable of communicating a horror incomprehensible to those who love humanity, the species that is at once her prince and irrevocable enemy.” I instantly fill with giddy excitement and immediately decide to go home and work. But there is song playing on the radio, quite a good song for radio pop, I think to myself, whith a female voice incanting variants of:</p>

<p><em>I tried to do handstands for you</em>
<em>but everytime I fell for you,</em>
<em>I’m permanently black and blue,</em>
<em>permanently blue for you you-ooh-ooh-ooh</em></p>

<p>I pack my things and go home.</p>

<p>Returning home in frenzied inspiration, I awake my computer from its nap and open a document I’m working on. But I recall the song that played on the radio at the café and I quickly download it. I play this pop song that seems especially nice to me. I still feel great, but before I know it 45 minutes have elapsed and I have not even looked at, let alone worked on, my document, while the male in the duo softly sings:</p>

<p>_I grabbed some frozen strawberries so I could ice your bruising knees
But frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste like….
All those frozen strawberries I used to chill your bruising knees,
Hot July ain’t good to me
I’m pink and black and blue for you._</p>

<p> *</p>

<p>The song is entitled “Bruises.” The song is by a band called Chairlift. Interestingly, Chairlift was an indie band with some underground credibility when Apple Computers chose this very song for the commercial introducing the 4th-generation iPod Nano. A difficult question, one probably impossible to answer definitively: Why did Apple choose this song from an unknown indie band? Businesses do nothing at random; that they perhaps used focus groups begs the question of why <em>this song</em> of all songs. If the consistency between advertising and its music is a convenient index of the ideological core of pop music, then this question serves as a heuristic for delineating the truth of profane pop music. To understand why this song fits so seemlessly with, of all things, the iPod Nano, would be at once to understand the structuring logic of “successful” mainstream pop music.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>In <em>Saint Genet</em>, Jean-Paul Sartre writes, “If you have only a crumb that has fallen from the table, your life will be spent in defending that crumb, in convincing others and yourself, in convincing others and yourself that it is the best of crumbs and that, in the last analysis, it contains the universe. Genet has nothing, which amounts to saying that he has an eminent right over everything. At this point there begins the systematic turning of the positive into the negative and the negative into the positive which later, carried to an extreme will lead Genet to ‘saintliness.’ In the ‘land of Chimeras,’ a conversion of signs is sufficient to change penury into wealth.”</p>

<p>Today, is the problem for capital not something like the inverse of Genet’s? That is, do we consumers not already have everything, giving us a right over nothing? This, then, as a guess, is perhaps the ultimate truth of pop music: to furnish desire for a population who already has everything and therefore possesses a right to nothing, to furnish this right, in other words. For, in the land of Chimeras a conversion of signs is also sufficient to change wealth into penury.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>How does pop music do this and, by way of the heuristic with which the analysis opened, is there evidence of precisely this logic exceptionally at work in the song already considered? Actually listening to R. Stevie Moore, as John Maus suggests, is unsettling and almost intolerable insofar as he exceeds and therefore violates the conventions defining the enjoyment of pop music. R. Stevie Moore makes one want to do better or at the very least do something else simultaneously; that which unsettles in R. Stevie Moore is perhaps what Sartre somewhere calls the “springboard of negativity,” the messy, ugly half of human creativity that most “right-thinking” bourgeois artists conceal but is precisely what drives work toward the “good,” the “beautiful,” etc.  As I listen to the infinitely charming pop song about doing handstands, I am so content that it is impossible to even want to do anything else.</p>

<p>This song is perhaps exceptional, is perhaps the perfect 21st century pop song and thus the ideal song for the iPod Nano commercial, because it does not even allow the listener the traditional object of desire to which pop music traditionally directed our fantasies. Namely, the duo of lovers both seem to love each other and yet they are for completely unknown reasons _still black and blue . _The song offers no conflict but nonetheless gets away with the vague impression of lack, a suffering, a completely unknown problem. The only contender in sight is gravity or clumsiness which are perhaps thwarting the poor girl’s handstands. We are forced to affirm either the literality of the handstand problem or else admit that this song is able to create a sense of loss despite the absence of any real problem in the world. Is this not exactly the kind of music that an advertising executive might pray for? Perhaps that is the profane truth of pop music.</p>

<p>Rustica is simply the best godd<em>mn place any second on this planet. I just ate a godd</em>mn buffalo chicken sicilian jigger for only $3, which is without a doubt the best pound-for-pound dollar-for-dollar thing to eat anywhere on this terrible website. It made me so f<em>cking happy I decided to sign up for this embarrassingly stupid website. It made me feel like I could be happy every second of every day just from once eating this thing that only cost $3; I was there all by myself, eating, and I just burst out laughing like a maniac. If you don’t go here every godd</em>mn day you are a maniac. A little girl was pointing up at the sign that says Rustica above the front door saying to her mommy how she liked it and I told her that I was the one who designed it, and I was! That’s how happy this place makes me every godd*mn day.</p>

<p>This place is so bad that to me the core of the consumer experience is that I would never even think about going to this place unless I was really thirsty/hypnotized, which I might be one day, but not today or ever right now. Judging by the fashion of the people who go here and the quality of the storefront—which I designed, by the way, today, in Photoshop, to make it less intolerably offensively poorly-designed—this place is overpriced, boring, and induces severe anxiety/fear for the nature/future of humanity.</p>

<p>This is the best bar and DJ house any f*cking minute of my life, any hemisphere since the Golden Age of ancient Greek civilization; I will recount everything that ever happened here to explain how good it is. Once when I was in college in 2004 I didn’t know places/things, I went there and felt it was exotic/scary/tattoos so then I got tattoos. I did not have intimacy that night (a morally dubious thing to say but this is the core of the consumer experience at this establishment, what the yelp guidelines ask for). Sometime after that I once danced with a girl for \~60 minutes on/off and it seemed clear that we liked each other and I almost had intimacy that night but we only kissed, which is not intimacy but rather is typically perceived to be a clarion call for an intimacy that is imminently on the horizon so to speak. Then I remember I went back years later after I had found myself and I just immediately felt at home in this safe haven that now features two different barbaries, one for foodies and people who don’t like to pay covers (upstairs/barbarella), one for people who like to pay \~3-5 dollars \~2-7 nights per week to get photographed by facebook (downstairs/barbary regular). That one night after I had found myself already and was really at home here, that night I had intimacy. Some people think its awkward when you see someone at the barbary after you only had one intimacy with them after the barbary but I don’t think it is. I think at some places it might be like that but it never is for me at the barbary. A new room on top of the upstairs was just released, this is mysterious/will probably go there soon, you should too. Think that probably there is a nuclear-bomb-shelter in the basement where the owner/employees/photographers/DJs/most-photographe d-people will go if there is ever nuclear war and they will keep an “underground” facebook that holds all the photography archives to be released after the war to kind of like “repopulate” the scene for the third barbary because, as some reviewers have already mentioned, the barbary is currently on its second life.</p>

<p>I honestly think what happened here was it used to be cool among white hipsters on Thursday nights when they played 90s hip-hop and then many black people and bro’s started going and now it is not cool among white hipsters. I’m willing to be corrected if this is not a fair description of this establishment’s evolution, but this is honestly what I remember observing as a decently well-educated roughly socially-aware member of the white hipster community. I don’t think any of my friends / anyone in my dating pool really goes here anymore and like, nothing else cool or interesting I know of really happens here, so the core of my consumer experience here is that it is irrelevant to my life at this point in time.</p>

<p>Has dance party called Banana Chips, this fake Mexican restaurant for white people who prefer white people to eating so much really good/cheap Mexican food nearby. Feel like they have parlor games like foosball which I’ve played before and it was fun. They have so many TVs it’s completely godd*mn bonkers no wonder people go upstairs and pay to get into Banana Chips, which I feel like is comparable to Sorted (@ Barbary) in terms of quality/attractiveness/fashion of patrons, but is probably dumber/worse, although I’ve never gone to it. To make this review even more confusing but honest, I feel like they have hosted \~8-75 hardcore music shows before. Like, wtf is this place?</p>

<p>First to Review
Was good as a spaghetti warehouse then it became the worst venue ever considering it’s never even had one godd<em>mn show. R5 really botched the job on this one: I went here a week ago to get spaghetti under really f</em>cking bright lights while listening to sh<em>tty radio pop music blasted in my dingus ears all f</em>cking night but it was closed because R5 bought it and R5 don’t know sh<em>t about spaghetti or warehouses. So I went back a week later to see a R5 show cuz it beats the sh</em>t out of radio pop blasting in your face while you’re trying to eat Pop’s Lasagna or whatever the godd*mn dish was called (RIP) but, lo and behold, no shows have ever been put on here so my first thought was that this place blows, gets one star, I’m hungry, break my life into pieces, this my last resort, yelp!, etc.</p>

<p>But then I read an exceptional piece of contemporary journalism in the Philadelphia Weekly, which I wish I could review on here but I can’t, and I learned that Union Transfer is the godd*amn best thing to ever happen to music in Philadelphia or anywhere else in the whole scheme of human history other than Bookspace. So the core of my consumer experience started off \~weak/terrible but is now and into the future just nothing short of Tiger Woods golf-quality, which is to say damn near perfect except when it sucks which is rare.</p>

<p>A failed diner that found success through a very clever change of business plan: hiring freelance hipsters to turn it into a local hipster bar and it largely succeeded with flying colors and now it makes mad bank probably and vegan cheesesteaks and “tots.” They very wisely hired the (cool, nice) kinda older hip dude who bartends (or used to bartend, idk) at Bob and Barbara’s and Ray’s and now attractive young people are in there all the time and it’s fantastic. Very generous happy hour, impossible to talk/hear your friends any time of any night given that DJs are f<em>cking bombarding your ears, nice outdoor seating with heaters, and if you get really drunk there and get tired of having your ears destroyed and you feel like an idiot for eating so much seitan you can walk two doors down and do kareoke at Connie’s Ric Rac or just go home on Facebook because the internet is honestly, seriously the best place to express yourself ever invented, like it makes Guttenberg look like a f</em>cking piece of child. Feel like the older hip dude they hired should inherit the place when Teri, like, quits or whatever. Feel like he “did all the work,” and is totally completely responsible for the success of that place. Feel like hipsters are exploited by older people who just use hipsters for their ability to draw crowds and all the profits go to f*cking normies you would never even think about dancing/kissing/intimacy with if they ever actually went to the place you go to and yet you are willing to essentially pour money down their pants, like seriously wtf is wrong with us are we idiots or just drunk / love karaoke too much. But aside from their structural role in the exploitation of hipsters for profit, the owners/manager people are pretty nice cool/too and the older hip dude who is responsible for all the success is cool so this place is great all around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Delivered at The Ox, August 18, 2011.</p>

<p>If God wrote the Bible today, he would be assassinated by the CIA because God was the most radical artist ever, creating so much in six days and only resting for one, never obeying a single law but only making up laws as he went. Socrates was, remember, assassinated by the CIA.</p>

<p>If you think you are an artist but do not get assassinated by the CIA, then it is probably evidence your work will not be very significant in the scheme of world history. If you do not currently hope to be assassinated by the CIA, then it is probably evidence you do not aim to achieve art that is significant in the scheme of world history. Why do you want to live so long, anyway? People say life is short but they are wrong. Life is so long. To be assassinated by the CIA for making art would be nice. I’m not saying anything bad about the CIA or America, but just that they hate really really powerful artists because powerful artists are like the God of the creation—which even James Joyce says—and the God of the creation is a threat to the power of the CIA and America. Thus, if you wish to be the best artist you kind of have to wish that the CIA and America want to kill you, even if you don’t dislike the CIA or America and you don’t want to die. It is a philosophical paradox of sorts.</p>

<p>On the roof of our warehouse long ago there was once a pillow clogging the drainpipe and so when it rained the whole roof became one great puddle. This would make toxic yellow water drip into our bedrooms through small leaks in the roof. The big great puddle is like your libido, this room is one great puddle of libido, and the pillow clogging the drainpipe is a famous figure called the DJ, the barbary is like a big room of pillows and you go there and DJs put pillows in your ears and mouths and it feels nice and you sometimes afterwards have sex on the pillows between 0 and at the very best maybe 75% of the time but even if you have sex, after you have sex, the big great puddle of desire is still sitting there, stagnating. And do you know what it’s doing? It’s leaking toxic yellow water into your bedrooms. It makes you unable to breathe and when you are with other humans you can never quite say exactly what you want to say or do exactly what you want to. That is why sometimes we cry. It is the great puddle leaking through our eyeballs.</p>

<p>And that is why you have come to our warehouse. Because guess what? We removed the pillow on the roof; there is no more toxic water leaking into our bedrooms; and you, all of you, you great great puddle of libido, you may now flow freely through the mighty drainpipe of Art, which is Revolution my rich friends!</p>

<p>For, everyone must understand that we are all rich. Why, you ask? Here we must follow Hegel: People with a lot of money are not rich because their wealth forces them to be wealthy, they have no freedom money. We, on the other hand, are all rich because we have no wealth that forces us to be wealthy, therefore we are rich in freedom money.</p>

<p>The artist is a person who has freedom money. Freedom money means doing anything you want whenever you want even though you don’t have money. If you are a true artist, money will just appear or people begin to give you things or else you can just invent things or people to give you things.</p>

<p>That is called creation: just inventing things and people and if you do it really well, and really mean it, then people will just give you things and money and anything you need. If you do this, if you are an artist, and you are rich in freedom, and you really do creations with all of your libido, every ounce of it, with no pillows in your mouths or ears, then you are a true artist which means you are God himself or herself and the CIA might want to assassinate you. In the bible, God began with no money at all and so he just invented the whole universe and people such as Jesus and ever since then people have never stopped giving him money. But if the CIA does not want to assassinate you then you are doing it wrong or not doing it enough, which is maybe what you want to do, I don’t know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ol>
<li>The traditional cinematic representation of communication&mdash;the perfectly crafted, expertly balanced, and of course well-timed expressions of emotion&mdash;is a double bourgeois ruse. It tricks us first into thinking that to every true emotion belongs an elegant and compelling presentation that is always to the credit of the presenter, even to the Fool who is nonetheless always a well-executed Fool, and then into desiring and expecting such modes of expression from ourselves and others. 2. However, in truth, in practice, the communication of emotions is most often and in its essence difficult, ugly, stupid, awkward, silly, embarrassing, and most importantly, almost always to the discredit and social devaluation of the communicator. Those who disagree with this will quickly realize that any compelling example to the contrary is not the communication of an emotion but the mimicking of traditional cinematic representations of communication. So far from pleasing and admirable, genuine efforts to express emotions truthfully are in essence obscene and punished harshly. For instance, even schoolchildren learn that pouring one&rsquo;s heart out to a beloved, no matter how skillfully derived from the best of the silver screen, will be met consistently with rejection. He wants to put her in his pocket and she should die there, smothered&mdash;thus teaches D.H. Lawrence somewhere in <em>Sons and Lovers</em>. 3. Thus, a profound dissonance exists between the nature of emotions, especially the obscene possessive and obsessional qualities of love, and how the cinema teaches us to desire, communicate, and desire communication. The contemporary subject always feels compelled to find that perfect cinema-like expression of one&rsquo;s feelings toward the beloved, and in turn we want to hear such expressions directed toward us, yet, emotions being what they are, we begin to hate ourselves and others for never being able to successfully express emotions to the great effect we come to expect through so many cinematic representations. 4. Social institutions mediate this dissonance, known in another register as alienation. Why is the nature of romantic love always a kind of violent obsessive possessiveness? Because the legal fact and concrete phenomenon which most significantly conditions the distribution of enjoyment across society is <em>possession</em>. In fact, when norms of private possession so thoroughly dominate social relations, it can almost be said that possession of a thing is required for it to concretely exist to the beholder. One must possess the beloved because in our society if one does not possess a thing or a person then one cannot enjoy the thing or person, and in fact, the thing or person becomes a purely spectral object of fantasy, that which failed to become real. Why does the beloved flee at the honest confessions of the young lover? It is because we know no values other than values derived from the general mechanism of pricing, and in the love market one&rsquo;s value or price is reflected by one&rsquo;s eagerness: the honest plea of true love is seen as evidence that one is not worth enough to have already been obtained by someone better on whom the love is actually being spilled. We flee from honest passionate love like we flee from a salesman in too great a rush: he must be trying so hard so quick precisely because he isn&rsquo;t finding buyers, which tells us that his product is no good. And truly independent valuation is so rare! Furthermore, true romantic abandon is prohibited by the social and political organization of modern society, which demands the repression of liberality and lovemaking in favor of work, making oneself scarce and thus more valuable, etc. Thus we flee from precisely what we aim to actualize and express, if only we could find the right words (as they do in the movies). 5. The mumblecore film, especially insofar as it makes love speak as a stuttering neurotic rather than a confident, successful Romeo, has gone a certain distance in exposing this ruse of bourgeois cinema and pointing toward the truth of real emotional speech in all of its idiocy. But it has not gone far enough, chiefly because the stuttering neurotic succeeds in executing his role to wildly unrealistic personal advantage. The same cinematic valorization of emotional expression persists, only in a goofier, less traditionally elegant figure. Be yourself, stuttering and stammering, and you shall prevail. But the truth is that no, you will not: At best, you will feign a cinematically-endorsed version of charming, quirky, neurotic mumbling which is even harder to execute than the old role of Romeo; at worst, you will take the bait and actually be yourself and maybe add some stammering to boot, thereby frightening, traumatizing, and repulsing every new acquaintance. 6. It follows that if the essential discovery of the mumblecore project is to be mined to its full aesthetic potential, it must press toward devalorizing the mumbling subject the emotional communication of whom it has so preposterously glorified for so long. What this entails is calling forth the straightforwardly obscene, vile, rude, pathetic, silly, ugly, and stupid aspects of real emotional communication in a way that avoids, through whatever technical means available, any retrospective cinematic valorization. In other words, display the horror of emotional communication without permitting some redemptive quality to redound to the perpetrator of the horrible emotional drivel&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so honest!&rdquo; or &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so cool he doesn&rsquo;t even care how terrible he is!&rdquo; and so forth. Such impressions should be avoided at all costs, even through extra-cinematic didactic aids, if necessary. This will have the effect of bringing the truth of contemporary emotions into line with the truth of contemporary communication, namely, the line in which they are both hard, difficult, ugly, impossible: the truth of contemporary alienation. For instance, in my recent release <em>Open Bar Tender</em>, my very own character is stupid, insensitive, and despicable despite vain or even positively shameful efforts at damage control. And I was only &ldquo;being myself,&rdquo; the pathetic naive loon I am. Capturing the idiocy and cold terror of true, free emotional or artistic communication is one truth accessible to the mumblecore film, which can be beautiful as an assemblage without valorizing the communicating subject. 7. Whereas the devalorization of emotional communication is to begin perhaps most naturally in dialogic experimentation, it will be in narrative structure that the destiny of mumblecore unravels its next essential intimation: the mise en scene of the institutions that mediate the dissonance or alienation between the communication of the emotional subject and the truth of the emotions which are to be expressed. In short, if mumblecore is to unravel its essential discovery it must not be afraid to explicitly give treatment to the institutions which condition the mumbling subject, which teach the subject to mumble. Let us see subjects in the process of demystification, subjects resolving alienation in temporal developments at the end of which poetry and revolution meet in the sublime. Only through the mis en scene of concrete demystification should the mumbling subjects be permitted valorized speech and retrospective valorization more generally, for they will have earned it in a fashion consistent with an accurate conception of the relationship between emotional communication and the nature of real emotions.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To enter the galleries of modern painting from the main entrance of the National Gallery one has to walk through two separate and gargantuan gift stores and two equally impressive dining areas. But really, this is appropriate and historically honest curation. In short, the National Gallery makes visitors access modern painting in the same fashion as history itself has accessed it: through consumption, through the postmodern.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My philosophy is shifting toward what I would like to term self-immiserative technomadism. The old Marxian hypothesis about the increasing immiseration of the working classes under capitalism has not fared well. The lowest classes apparently have more to lose than their chains, and thus one of the key revolutionary mechanisms theorized in the Marxist tradition is irrelevant in the advanced liberal democracies. I think an attractive solution is the self-immiseration of the disillusioned factions of the bourgeoisie. That is, I am increasingly convinced that to see the world clearly and to avoid all of the social investments that make us conservative and reactionary, we need to opt for a calculated kind of squalor. Not the demoralizing, unprovocative kind of squalor too often associated with traditional drifters, dropouts, and squatters, but an intellectually, artistically, politically radical kind of squalor. Technomadism is the name for just one component of this calculated squalor: it implies minimizing everything that keeps us anchored in the status quo (and thus blind to and invested in the status quo) in order to maximize the freedom, effectivity, and productivity of our connections to increasingly dominant technological desiring machines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I paid $20 to Skype for a personal phone number good for three months. Incoming calls are free (as far as I can tell) and $14 more got me credits for making calls, which are only 2.3 cents/minute. Say I speak for 5 minutes per day, which is more than I typically do, that means $14 gets me almost 5 months. I am breaking my cell phone contract ($110) rather than pay $50/month for the next nine months until my contract is over. <strong>Friends</strong>: <strong>You will find my new phone number on my Facebook page. It comes with voicemail, too. If you ever really need me, I&rsquo;d suggest you first email or message me on Facebook because I am always on both of those.</strong></p>

<p>I am doing this for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saving money. I hate bills and I hate cell phone companies. At $50/month that is about $600/year. At $20 every three months, and $14 every 5, that will be less than $150/year. I will save 600 &ndash; 150 = $450/year.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phones are stupid machines. If you have a smart phone, it might not be as stupid as most but it is still stupid. They have a penchant for jumping into toilets, distracting you from more interesting things, ringing during class/meetings/conversations, breaking, and being stolen. I despise all of these things and I&rsquo;m looking forward to putting them behind me.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phones are oppressive. To me, ignoring calls is rude and if someone calls me while I&rsquo;m not necessarily immediately busy, I owe it to him or her to pick up. Cell phones stay in your pocket all the time and they offer you no acceptable reason for not talking on the phone if you are able. In maximizing your accessibility in a sense you maximize your freedom of movement, but paradoxically you make yourself beholden to anyone calling you at any time and thus you limit your freedom (unless you ignore calls or turn your phone off, options I never found attractive.)</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Suzanne Goldenberg of the <em>Guardian</em> reports a graph, apparently by <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/spais/people/person/148552">Matthew Hope</a> of the University of Bristol, to illustrate the claim that Obama is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">less interested in climate change than Bush</a>. This comes on the heels of several critics who point out that Obama did not mention climate change once in his past State of the Union address. The graph displays aggregate mentions of &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environnment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfutfsoliB1qz9517.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>However, as Ben Jervey of <em>Good</em> points out, Goldenberg&rsquo;s inference from her analysis <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">is wrong</a>. As Jervey suggests, Obama&rsquo;s lack of interest in &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; is due simply to a shift in rhetorical strategy, as Obama has chosen to frame the problems of climate change as an issue of &ldquo;clean energy.&rdquo; An analysis similar to Goldenberg&rsquo;s provides some compelling evidence for the latter view. Below, I&rsquo;m posting a graph comparable to Goldenberg&rsquo;s but with mentions of &ldquo;energy&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo; As graphics should, this largely speaks for itself:<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfuudeGs1v1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>
