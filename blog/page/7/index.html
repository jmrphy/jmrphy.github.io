title: On the bureaucratic superego and conventional constitution of siege by joint emancipated forces
categories:</p>

<h2>&ndash; theory</h2>

<p>Over the past five hundred years, political repression has been slowly but steadily delegated to the individual. The <em>bureaucratic superego</em> is what I call the function by which the individual prohibits itself from doing things that in the past would have been the jurisdiction of the Law. The driving force for this transfer of functions has been the flexibility of movement desired and required by capital over the course of history. But here we recall and reformulate that essential Marxian insight concerning the tendency of capitalism to produce its own contradictions. Society’s evolutionary delegation of bureaucratic superegos to take over a task once performed by the Law has permitted and encouraged the Law to become lazy, complacent, or in other words, under-resourced, as the system over time distributed its energies away from everyday legal rigidity in favor of the flexible nomos required by the spinning of a market society from feudal threads.</p>

<p>Consider the university, which once upon a time was a physically guarded and socially sacred space that the uninitiated were literally prohibited from entering, let alone participating in. Over time, because of economic pressures such as the need for a greater quantity of educated workers—and for many other complex reasons, of course—the aristocratic gatekeepers were forced to open the gates as it were. They certainly didn’t want to. When they were forced to, powerholders only opened slowly, dragging their feet, but they also naturally liberalized in ways that maintained their gatekeeping authority. This is observable, for instance, in what we know call the “admissions process” but which is really more like a refusal or filtering process. Thus, today they still effectively prohibit entry by the lower classes beyond that which is absolutely required by economic pressures. That said, what needs to be stressed is how much, in the slow process of liberalizing the universities, the gatekeepers job was already delegated to the very undesirables themselves in the form of an obedient habitus hammered into shape by a long and bloody few centuries of early modern, capitalist subjectivation.</p>

<p>To come to the point, the successful evolution of reliable docility among the masses has enabled and encouraged institutions such as universities to become huge, sprawling, overpopulated, bureaucratically confused and chaotic social spaces. Almost all contemporary institutions smugly prioritize profitability to such an extreme degree that as far as legal exploration is concerned, it’s as if the owner of a jewelry store forgot to close its door one night and never came back. Colleges, for instance, are perfectly unguarded palaces of knowledge—any bum with a state ID can sit in the back of Intro to Zoology, look through some art books in the library, openly take some pens and paper from the History Department’s mail room, and launch a more intelligent and revolutionary research program than most enrolled students. All for free, all quite legally and rather without hassle, too!</p>

<p>Now, of course, very few people excluded from higher education take or occupy the education that is laughably available to them at no monetary, legal, or bureaucratic expense, but they fail to do so chiefly because of the variegated historical tendencies that culminate in the production of what I’m here calling the bureaucratic superego. In other words, capitalism over hundreds of years policed the masses into obedience so effectively that it now essentially trusts them to police themselves. It is astounding, that a whole system whose essential characteristic is dishonor (recall that a contract society is by definition a society lacking honor), relies for its very existence on what is essentially an honor system that only applies to the most disadvantaged.</p>

<p>The imperative for the revolutionary avant-garde is simple and obvious.</p>

<p>There exists a space marked out between our habits of everyday life and the actual existence of state power: to the side of the police line held by our bureaucratic superegos are all of our everyday, routine thoughts and behaviors, and across a finite space are the seats of power legally enforced by state police and ultimately the military. Within this space, a space with finite width but infinite depth, are all of the imaginable behaviors over which complacent institutions have no control but which we currently fail to perform because we are thoroughly dominated by bureaucratic superegos, the police function evolutionarily delegated to human subjectivity over the past five hundred years. <strong>Beginning now with the arrival of its theoretical comprehension, this space should now be conceived as formally liberated territory to be occupied immediately by all members of the entire international revolutionary avant-garde.</strong></p>

<p>It is worth noting, for example, how this present piece of writing, itself occupying the very space the formal liberation of which it is inaugurating for the whole international avant-garde, is essentially the first of its kind in the history of humanity insofar as it is able peacefully and legally announce and call for a real, concrete global revolution that would literally and effectively replace every currently existing government instantly. Because of their bureaucratic superegos which teach them to distrust and dismiss any first glimpses of human freedom, this document will appear to most bourgeois artists and scientists as delusional ravings with a child’s fingerpainting attached, and of course it is, but by a child Hegelian enough to realize it’s nonetheless the most authentic artistic, scientific, and political achievement ever accomplished by a young man inhabiting the unpoliced terrain of his society’s most advanced intellectual, aesthetic, and technological capabilities. What will appear first as apparently delusional ravings will, precisely in its unapologetic freedom and through a dialectic I will now proceed to elaborate, irresistbly inspire others around the globe to occupy this same infinite space of unpoliced possibilities.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we may also observe here an implication of the highest significance. Let us for convenience name “avant-garde” the revolutionary tendency in art and “vanguard” the equivalent in politics, as the etymology obviously suggests. Then, each tendency can be conceptualized as parallel phalanxes converging on the same open enemy territory. The politicized occupations of legally unpoliced space (as in the U.S. occupation sights before the evictions) as well as entrances into open buildings for the purpose of protest is known as “direct action.” Direct action, although converging on state power, does not intend the forcible occupation of the seat of state power itself,what the revolutionary tradition shortsightedly called “taking power.” This is perhaps because history has shown over the past century that the forcible occupation of the seats of state power is not truly “taking power,” but rather its opposite, namely, being “taken by power.” This, of course, has been the fate of all authoritarian socialisms or communisms. It is now possible, however, to see that truly taking power without being taken by power would be for the revolutionary phalanxes of art and politics to both converge on the enemy territory via the unpoliced fronts of everyday life.</p>

<p>Diagrammtically, the revolutionary phalanxes must be conceived as starting at one point but widening as they move forward toward state power. The simple reason why the avant-garde as well as the vanguard have been critical concepts in both traditions is not because there need to be leaders, as in the disastrously erroneous doctrine of Leninism. The limited quantity of representatives in any emergent avant-garde or vanguard is simply a function of the evolutionary fact that everything has to start somewhere, with some minor perturbation in the system. And it is no criticism of the individuals first possessed of the revolutionary perturbations that they are merely “privileged” or “bourgeois” as if that disqualifies them. It is conservative bourgeois ideology to critique revolutionaries for being bourgeois, for not only is it a patently _ad hominem_ argument, it’s effect is simply to use the force of an arbitrary idea to disqualify the only wing of the proletariat who have the resources (time, education, technology, etc), in other words, who have the privilege of revolutionary consciousness and activity. It is no criticism because if they are truly revolutionary, their only function is to spread freedom through contagion, to embody a freedom whose specific nature and function is to proliferate and multiply itself through <a href="http://Justin%20Murphyields.tumblr.com/post/14482890002/the-occupations-hipsterdom-and-the-resexualization-of">a process I’ve modeled in a previous section with respect to the political vanguard</a> and according to which the avant-garde will expand just as well. In any event, we should conceptualized both revolutionary wings as widening and converging phalanxes as in the diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwhskqVGyw1qz9517.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Understood this way, we gain a picture of revolutionary strategy that is a rediscovery of the traditional military tactic known as siege. It implies a theory of siege updated for an era in which the notions of guerilla warfare or armed struggle are nothing short of nostalgiac fantasies literally bought and sold peacefully, opiates dished out to the rebelliously-minded. But neither are we offering here a merely mental consumption good for postmodern theorists. This is an immediate call to action, and in fact represents yet another rediscovery of an archetypal political tradition stood on its feet in an era standing on its head. I am hereby declaring what is essentially a constitutional convention for the revolutionary avant-garde—a congregation in which all interested parties come together for the purpose of demolishing a particular political organization in favor of constituting a new one. However, for the revolutionary avant-garde today, the traditional order of terms must be reversed if the concept is to be truthful. Everywhere one borrows the equations of bourgeois political ideology, they must be turned back on their feet.</p>

<p>It is thus that we should hereby announce our <em>conventional constitution</em> rather than a constitutional convention. The constitutional convention traditionally functions as a sort of engine that is supposed to power a new political society according to variable tempos and rythms with, for instance, the American “separation of powers” functioning as a literal throttle of democratic desire. But the whole charade involves nothing more than instituting or constituting conventions, intended for the behavior and language of others to converge on (as per the philosophical tradition known as conventionalism). The bourgeois ideological formula offers the public the fantastic idea that a society is convening in order to produce a constitution that will govern it, whereas all that happens is a few of the most powerful individuals constitute conventions to be imposed by legal force on a subject population.</p>

<p>Today, where the revolutionary avant-garde in the artistic sphere meets the revolutionary political vanguard in the contemporary global movement to occupy everything, including every last cobwebbed corner of conceptual space, at that precise point of intersection we <em>lay siege</em> to all currently existing bourgeois governments by creatively performing the truth they dissimulate. By truthfully pronouncing in absolute seriousness the current formation of a revolutionary united front through conventional consitution as literally the only legitimate government of the entire globe, we effectively and realistically lay siege to all bourgeois governments currently existing insofar as we literally do exactly what they did, but for the first time in world history we do it transparently and honestly. In this way, doing exactly what they did, but for the first time in human history doing it from the bottom up in an international mass movement, we will literally have them surrounded. And the reason I cannot stress enough that this is truly a real siege and not merely “symbolic,” and that this would truly be sufficient for real, concrete political revolution, is that the siege truly cuts state power off from one of its essential, vital functions, the bureaucratic superegos of its self-policed subjects. The conventional consitution of the revolutionary united front effectively does this because the bureaucratic superego quickly defects when the ego is exposed to contact with true human freedom, which, to put forward a provisional definition, might be something like the consciousness of the nonexistence of restraints.</p>

<p>To better specifiy the real and concrete effectivity of the revolutionary avant-garde in occupying the unpoliced yet unexplored space of contemporary life, the operative causal mechanism is to give the public irresistible performances of true human freedom to which they’re bureaucratic superegos are fatally allergic. The logic of political direct action aims for the same achievement on the political plane. There, activists demonstrate, not least by dramatizing their absurd defecit of power and thus a certain charming and inspiring impossibility or martyrdom called civil disobedience, the fantastic notion that anyone can fight the system. It operates according to a dialectically self-fulfilling prophecy. Their performance is artistic (deceptive) because to truly fight the system would in fact require the participation of everyone in society, but their performance makes it possible for others to believe that anyone can fight the system, thus producing a tendency toward the conditions for which anyone could fight the system (in the sense of being part of everyone fighting the system). And thus we come to understand how the revolutionary avant-garde converges dialectically with the revolutionary vanguard.</p>

<p>In their true forms, the revolutionary artist is a political revolutionary (constituting the first and only legitimate global government in the history of humankind) while the political revolutionary is a revolutionary artist (performing the most beautiful act in the history of humankind, that of the individual who can defeat a whole social system).</p>

<p>I simply cannot stress enough how the theoretical strategy elucidated here cannot be dismissed with the old reality versus theory criticism (which Marx himself helped popularize with respect to interlocutors such as Proudhon) that would say this is giving to the conceptual sphere a pracitical effectivity that is simply delusional. I have elaborated concrete causal mechanisms by which conceptual activity has effects on the level of practical behavior and political developments. These could potentially be wrong, but they require analysis and argumentation from anyone who will claim this is merely highfalutin theory.</p>

title: U.S. media and ideological filtering as a global &ldquo;public good&rdquo;
wordpress_id: 90
categories:
&ndash; theory</p>

<h2>&ndash; social science</h2>

<p>In the study of international relations, there is a conventional and well-demonstrated theory according to which 1.) global stability is to be understood as a “public good,” and 2.) that due to strategic problems obstructing collective cooperation, often a hegemon is required to effectively subsidize it (Krasner 1976; Kindleberger 1981). Put very simply, in the absence of a hegemon, the global system tends toward conflict in a &ldquo;race to the bottom.&rdquo; Many states with more or less equal power and acting in their own self-interest calculate that, for instance, raising tariffs will help their domestic industries. However, the outcome is that as every other state acts similarly, all countries fare worse than they would have had they not raised tariffs. A global hegemon can prevent this bad equilibrium by effectively enforcing global free trade. More specifically, it is commonly argued that these conditions characterized the global system immediately after World War II, with the United States subsidizing the construction of an “embedded liberalism” (Ruggie 1983) and using “strategic restraint” (Ikenberry 2001) to favor global free trade rather than traditional militaristic domination.</p>

<p>We can develop and further specifiy this line of thought by elaborating how one of the “public goods” subsidized by liberal American hegemony was perhaps the maintenance of a certain ideological hygiene for the postwar capitalist order. One could argue that U.S. culture industry, nurtured by a media market that exemplifies the liberal, commercial model of state-media relations as well as a liberal bourgeois public opinion, has functioned as a sort of protective filter in global media circulation, a vacuum drain that shoots into the dumpster of forgotten history any ugly flotsam that rises up from the placid sea of global capitalist ideology. </p>

<p>This filter for the global desiring machine performs the specific and essential function of making any threat to the system replaced by whatever U.S. media puts in its place. The US media, in this model, is a sort of condom for catching the ejaculant of global capitalism, preventing the excesses of capitalist desire from fertilizing offspring that will ultimately contest the father.</p>

<p>More recently, variation across the covers of Time Magazine’s different regional editions provide stunning evidence for this claim. Below are the various regional editions of Time Magazine for the weeks of October 24th and December 5th of this writing (2011).</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwhb4v7QFj1qz9517.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwhb0p8eU01qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whereas the rest of the world sees a proud Egyptian revolutionary in a gas mask, readers in the United States see a story not just about anxiety, but why it&rsquo;s &ldquo;good for you.&rdquo; These images, only suggestive from a social scientific perspective, provide almost too-provocative evidence of the hypothesis advanced in the last section, that differences in U.S. news reportage perform a certain function of ideological filtering for global flows of desire. </p>

<p> Although we remain for the moment agnostic with respect to the specific characteristics of the U.S. media that lead it to function as global ideological filter, the hypothesis along with the patently conservative biases exemplified in these magazine covers would be consistent with the dyanmic patterns of variation <a href="http://Justin%20Murphyields.tumblr.com/post/14483036324/a-return-of-the-repressed-preliminary-theory-and">uncovered previously using data from Google Books</a>. Material political or economic shocks to the system (radical rebellions such as that of May 1968 in France or the Egyptian uprising this past year) enters into regional or global news but is prevented from causing truly global disruptions of consciousness by a domestic U.S. media quickly replacing it with the sterile human interest stories for which it is famous. Because the U.S. is one of the chief exporters of culture in the world, this sterilization of news consumption for even just the U.S. domestic market represents an <em>energy sink</em> for the whole global system. If revolutionary energy doesn’t get in, it obviously doesn’t get sent back out, and this is especially significant because so much of global culture is set by the American culture industries.</p>

title: A return of the repressed? Preliminary theory and evidence on France, 1968
  and Occupy Wall Street
wordpress_id: 92
categories:
&ndash; theory</p>

<h2>&ndash; social science</h2>

<p>Only about 40 years ago the advanced, developed, democratic republic of France was very nearly overthrown by an egalitarian, non-Soviet, non-authoritarian, spontaneous, and mass-democratic political revolution. The most remarkable aspect of the events surrounding May of 1968 in France is how unfathomably distant its subjective experience seems from our own political consciousness today in a country such as the United States, considering how still extremely recent was 1968. Returning to these events, it is impossible to avoid the suspicion that between then and now there must have transpired some sort of deeply nefarious historiographical scandal.</p>

<p>On the one hand, many of the protesters as well as observers at the time were possessed of an authentic certainty that their movement marked the “beginning of the end” for modern capitalism and the modern state. Interestingly and perhaps most compellingly, it is well after the revolutionary insurrection fails that one finds some of the most confident testimony that nothing short of a new threshold of political history had been irrevocably crossed. From the _International Situationniste_ #12 of 1969:</p>

<blockquote><p>The movement was a rediscovery of collective and individual history, an awakening to the possibility of intervening in history, an awareness of participating in an irreversible event. (“Nothing will ever be the same again.”) People looked back in amusement at the strange existence they had led a week before, at their outlived survival. It was a passion for bringing everything and everyone together that included a holistic critique of all alienations, of all ideologies and of the entire old organization of real life.</p></blockquote>

<p>…previously it was the subversion of the existing society that seemed unlikely; now it is its continuation.</p>

<p>The proof that it had established its own new legitimacy is that the regime reestablished in June has never, in its striving to restore internal state security, dared to prosecute those responsible for overtly illegal actions, those who had partially divested it of its authority and even of its buildings.</p>

<p>What is more, the activists of May ‘68 in France had very little doubt that their experiences were part of an unstoppable, international occupation movement. Almost unbelievably, this radical French journal of 1969 refers to an article from Agence France-Presse calling for nothing short of—it is almost unbelievable—the _occupation of Wall Street_:</p>

<blockquote><p>This perspective is not limited to France, it is international. The total significance of the occupations movement must be understood everywhere. Already in 1968 its example touched off, or pushed to higher levels, severe disorders throughout Europe and in America and Japan. The most remarkable immediate consequences of May were the bloody revolt of the Mexican students, which was able to be crushed due to its relative isolation, and the Yugoslavian students’ movement against the bureaucracy and for proletarian self-management, which partially drew in the workers and put Tito’s regime in great danger…</p></blockquote>

<p>It is easy to recognize throughout the world the new tone with which a radical critique is pronouncing its declaration of war on the old society — from the graffiti on the walls of England and Italy to the extremist Mexican group _Caos_, which during the summer of 1968 called for the sabotage of the Olympics and of “the society of spectacular consumption”; from the acts and publications of the Acratas in Madrid to the shout of a Wall Street demonstration (AFP, April 12), “Stop the Show,” in that American society whose “decline and fall” we already pointed out in 1965 and whose very officials now admit that it is “a sick society.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the masses of the liberal democratic or “advanced-capitalist” world of only about 40 years later seem to have not the slightest knowledge that such an earth-shattering political development ever took place so recently, that revolution in the richest and most powerful countries of the world today is not only imaginable—a hard enough argument to even begin today—but that it had been arguably hours away from succeeding only a few years ago. Only 40 years later, almost everybody would affirm the proposition that today, in a country such as France or the United States, revolution is impossible. If asked to seriously think about it, even most educated Americans would probably think of Lenin at best, and even then only in the form of a little cartooned bald man running around a backwards country in another epoch, over where and back when people were just “kinda crazy” or something. One might try to account for ignorance of the French events of May ‘68 by noting the general and pervasive lack of historical knowledge among most people today, and in the United States, especially. But in the midst of the current unrest, the several direct, undeniable parallels between our own burgeoning movement and the movement of May ‘68 in France elevates its absence from public consciousness into something more. It demands a symptomatic reading of this current silence regarding what just a little bit of research reveals to be an ecstastically obvious historical continuity.</p>

<p>That is, I would like to stake out the hypothesis, first of all, that May ‘68 in France, as the high water mark for the revolutionary project in the Western world, and precisely because of how high the water went, and how recently, has been historically repressed. Just as in the traditional Freudian schema, an event that was intolerably traumatic for modern capitalism was pushed out of popular consciousness through specifiable mechanisms of ideological and material repression, and the evidence of this repression can be adduced in the form of clinically predictable neurotic patterns following the trauma. For instance, I can show that in the contemporary media chatter on the U.S. occupation movement, we find demonstrable patterns of repetition compulsion, textbook neurosis. This first position transitions into a second position, which is that the achievements of May ‘68, combined with ample and straightforward lessons gleaned from its failure, provide the strongest blueprint for the revolutionary transcendence of capitalism that modern political philosophy can elucidate at the current juncture. Some of these lessons were even elucidated by some of the French radicals immediately after their own failure for the sake of what they were certain would be widespread and confident do-overs around the world, lessons elucidated as if the revolutionary tradition after May ‘68 was in the position of a golfer who just missed a put by an inch and, hardly needing to begin all over, could now just tap the ball in with only one hand on the club! Finally, I close on some considerations of the significant differences, material and ideological, that distinguish our situation from that of May ‘68 in France, demonstrating not only that the true historical destiny of the occupation movement is revolutionary, but that despite skepticism or in a certain dialectical sense because of it, the revolutionary project has never been more excitingly poised for world-historical success.</p>

<p>Using rather extraordinary data made available by the Google corporation, it is possible to initiate an empirical consideration of the hypothesis concerning a demonstrable historical repression of the revolutionary demiurge of the late 60s. The following graphs depict the frequency with which the word “revolution” occurs in books published over the past two centuries. Obviously, the figures do not refer to all books published in this period, but a sample of roughly four percent of all books, or more than five million. Books being an index of the terms with which a society understands itself, this data permits an extremely powerful if only preliminary analysis of the long-term dynamics of social consciousness.</p>

<p>In fact, the data offers interesting evidence for an extraordinary claim. At the end of the 1960s, the question of revolution was farther to the front of the global mind than it ever had been for the preceding two centuries.  At the beginning of the 1970s, it begins a conspicuous plummeting until it is erased from the social text more thoroughly than at any previous moment in those two centuries. Hardly anywhere does it rise higher and fall more precipitously than in American English.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvzwca5b3Y1qz9517.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course, it could be argued that after ‘68, the prospect of revolution objectively receded (in other words, the events of May ‘68 stopped and the capitalist order was restored), and thus naturally our overall cultural concern with it decreased accordingly. But first, it is important to not limit our empirical reflections to the contemporary academic ideology that fetishizes linear causality between independent and dependent variables. Social scientists are typically undertrained in dialectical thinking. It is of course possible that the desire to remove something from the symbolic order is precisely what drives the political acitivity of repressing its conditions objectively, such that we don’t need to be Nietzsche to affirm that a long-term historical (symbolic) repression after the fact can, in a sense, cause the objective repression that precedes it—insofar as the long-term symbolic repression can be counted on in advance to insure the objective repression, an insurance structured precisely by the dominant academic ideology of linear relationships between things in the world and consciousness of those things. We should say that if there are good measures to gauge an objective receding of the revolutionary threat, and even if such objective developments preceded the cultural trends highlighted here, this would not mean we are looking at an innocent and natural shift of thinking in response to objective reality. For, since the capitalist order that was objectively restored after May ‘68 was motivated by a conscious political desire to literally repress the traumatic occurrence and its superficial material conditions, if at the same time the trauma recedes from the social text according to a pattern that is quicker and/or of a greater degree than the objective repression of the conditions for the emergence of the trauma, then it is perfectly fair and necessary to isolate and observe a distinct process that is the historical repression of the trauma.  Even if differences in the relative dynamics and intensities do not provide standout evidence of a distinct historical repression that can be separated from the objective repression, we nonetheless would not need to shy away from explicating and defending the distinct reality of an historical repression, given that objective and historical forms of repression should be understood simply as two aspects of one socially systematic process of the repression of traumas.</p>

<p>Further evidence in favor of a systematically repressive process in historical symbolic consciousness is found in the patterns of dynamic variation across corpora. It seems highly significant that in the American English corpus the sudden disappearance of revolution is quickest and most extensive, followed by England, Germany, and then finally France itself. That is, the theory of historical repression very well predicts that the sort of immediate, nervous reflex to simply act as if nothing ever happened is most likely to occur precisely where its material reality is least present. In short, it’s easier to forget the primal scene if you didn’t actually see it, it’s most difficult if you witnessed it for yourself.  This is indeed one possible story the data narrates.</p>

title: The occupations, hipsterdom, and the resexualization of radical politics
wordpress_id: 94

<h2>&ndash; theory</h2>

<p>Voices in mainstream media debate whether the American occupation movement is or will become a _bona fide_ national political movement. Predictably, many sympathizers on the left do not hesitate to call it such, while critics, mostly on the right and mostly those who have the most to lose from a serious resurgence of militant democracy, dismiss our present insurrection as child’s play. Is it the 99% not yet fully organized, or less than one percent pretending to speak for the masses? From the loosely ethnographic perspective of a reflective participant (in Occupy Philadelphia), I would like to relate a set of observations that speak powerfully in favor of the long-term and revolutionary potential of current developments. Additionally, I would argue these observations portend a radical _coupure_ in American political culture the logic of which I will articulate from an informally game-theoretic perspective.</p>

<p>It has been a commonplace for decades: we live in a post-political age. Daniel Bell, 1960, _The End of Ideology<em>. Fukuyama via Hegel, 1992, _The End of History</em>. So on and so forth. No ideology has more effectively repressed revolutionary desire, especially in one of the cohorts from whom it often explodes in radical public protest—the youth and young adults—than this ideology of the end of ideology. For my whole young adult life—I am 25—politics has been more or less implicitly prohibited from the conversation of young, educated, urban, hipster milieus. Familiarity with current events and a vague leftism have always been a plus, of course, but the idea of, say, inviting a good-looking and fashionably-dressed young woman to a political event has never really been, let us say, socially feasible. Because _everybody knows that politics is dead<em>, because _everybody knows protests don’t work</em>, overly explicit and overly sincere identifications with serious political change in the United States, let alone with radicalism, for as long as I can remember have been perceived by the bulk of even privileged-but-disillusioned young adults as just corny anachronisms for political nerds. All of us coming of age after the fall of the Berlin Wall have been drinking that Kool-Aid since birth, especially the most socially-savvy, the most fashionable, the handsomest!</p>

<p>That is, the coolest, most fashionable, and sexually-prized individuals of the urban hipster milieus across our country have earned their positions at least in part by internalizing and restylizing the ideology of post-politics so successfully. And insofar as post-political position-takings have accrued cultural capital, there have prevailed strong incentives internal to youth culture that reinforce political apathy.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the alignment of socio-sexual desirability and political apathy is not by any means normal: it’s an historical anomaly. It is not a coincidence that in the 1960s, Mark Rudd and Bernardine Dorhn in the U.S., Daniel Cohn-Bendit aka _Dany Le Rouge_ in France, and Rudi Dutschke in Germany were all babes, sex symbols of modern student resistance in its prime. Clearly, no cultural context is more likely to keep young adults politically complacent and pacified than ours, that in which the hippest, most socially and sexually desirable young adults tend to be paragons of post-politics, a situation that has prevailed since I can remember.</p>

<p>However, using my own experiences as examples, and the logic of political science as a guide, I can demonstrate how one of the occupation movement’s most politically radical achievements in the U.S. might very well be to break the decades-old, silent complicity between the ultra-conservative ideology of post-politics on the one hand, and socio-sexual desire on the other. If correct, this will suggest that the occupation movement will not only become a true national political movement but that it may mark a watershed in the long-run political subjectivity of American youth and American political culture more generally.</p>

<p>From some basic principles of political science we can outline a simple model.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Before Occupy Wall Street, the ideology and norms of “post-politics” had a captive audience; if one wanted to sleep with hip people but also happened to be more politically motivated than hipster norms permitted, there was no viable strategy for “going it alone,” and trying to make politics hip through the old trick of starting a trend by stylishly violating an old one. There would have been a special conundrum about such a strategy in the case of post-politics, namely that to succeed in bucking this trend one would inherently need enough hipster-turned-comrades to avoid furnishing proof for the cynical trope that “protesting never works.” And of course, to organize such a critical mass by getting individual hipsters to defect from post-politics, one would need to already have the critical mass! (For it to be socially worthwhile for any individual to defect.) It was a very steady equilibrium.</p></li>
<li><p>The emergence of Occupy Wall Street was what we could call an exogenous shock: something outside the system capable of disrupting its equilibrium. All of a sudden there was a place where young adults could go at any time, for obvious reasons unmolested by cynical post-politics, and just hang out. At first, this would mean that maybe only the most privately, politically-motivated hipsters (those who are most oppressed by having to censor themselves in non-political social contexts but do so because there’s just no other way to meet and sleep with hip people) go and occupy or otherwise participate variably. But because a public occupation is a focal point that draws in people from any of the areas surrounding it, an occupation could draw as few as two hipsters from each major neighborhood in the city before all of a sudden there is a handful of fashionable good-looking kids being political in a high-visibility public square, now receiving media attention, no less!</p></li>
<li><p>So these first few hipsters are disalienated and nourished by the newfound release from what they only now see, in retrospective contrast, as the repressive post-political norms of the old, inert hipster groupings. All of a sudden they are thinking, developing, and speaking exciting ideas they maybe never even knew they were capable of having. But in addition, they are doing it with at least one or two actually attractive, actually hip people! The hitherto unknown combination of exercising political will alongside legitimate and exciting sexual prospects means that these hipsters have no reason to return to the old, larger post-political hipsterdom. The occupation offers nothing less than a viable strategy for a potentially permanent exit from post-political hipsterdom.  (Of course, there have always been radical political projects such as Food Not Bombs where a hip kid could possibly meet another good-looking hip kid. But my impression—right or wrong and probably wrong—was always that these projects attracted mostly “crust-punk” or similar styles only on the fringes of what is already the fringe of mainstream culture. For this reason, these projects or movements have never been able to attract a mass exodus of defectors from the bulk of middle-of-the-road hipsters. And, furthermore, they could never offer a 24/7 hangout spot literally open to all.)</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, the still currently dominant, currently post-political hipsterdom is itself in a state of crisis. Or, at least, it is at a point of stagnation that is highly dangerous for a system—not unlike modern capitalism itself—that requires perpetual innovation and novelty. The crisis has to do with the information environment.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>When I was in college, it was sufficient for both guys and girls to don a pair of tight black pants to effectively signal to anyone in sight that they were of the same ilk, that they generally hated the same things, generally liked the same things, vaguely rejected mainstream culture and bourgeois expectations, were vaguely leftist, etc. My cohort of hipsters now have what in game theory is called a “signaling problem.” Wearing tight pants six years ago was not exactly radical, but was rare enough that the decision to do so was a commitment to incur opprobrium or derision at least from some bourgeois superiors. It didn’t take a Sid Vicious to wear tight-pants, but it was socially “costly” enough that those who adopted the style could be trusted to have honest counter-cultural commitments; they wouldn’t incur the costs if they were just disingenuously affecting a counter-cultural demeanor to get laid in hipster circles. Over the past few years, as happens to all things once the privilege of cool innovators, basically everyone and their mother have come to wear “skinny” pants and associated styles. Tattoos, similarly, are quickly becoming acceptable in more and more social contexts, and therefore losing their signaling power. My cohort’s counter-cultural fashion sense has not kept pace. Our eyes are still trained on skinny pants and associated styles even as they continue to lose all association with actual counter-cultural commitments held by those who wear them.</p>

<p>Thus, there is right now an exigency internal to the real, authentic, counter-cultural substratum of the larger, now falsely-inflated hipsterdom, that perhaps explains the timing of the occupation movement’s capacity for resexualizing radical politics. That is, I am effectively arguing that over the past few years there has been a speculative bubble in hipsterdom—more and more people buying stock in hipster lifestyle (e.g. clothes) not because of actual counter-cultural commitments (real value) but only hoping to sleep with cooler people (speculation). And as in most speculative bubbles, an exogenous shock was required to break the reinforcing circularity of confidence and (falsely) rising value. That is, we probably excused and permitted bourgeois folks sneaking into counter-cultural milieus because we were like the holders of mortgage derivatives early in the housing bubble: in our beds we might have known we were holding worthless pieces of clothing but we did it anyway because at the time we could all pretend we were just rich with counter-cultural babes. The occupations are for reasons outlined above (their physicality, perpetuity, and openness) the first viable counter-cultural egress from the hipster bubble.</p>

<p>The mortgage crisis and subsequent recession were one cause of Occupy Wall Street, of course, but that Occupy Wall Street should take off at the present juncture and not, say, at the beginning of the recession or at the time of the bailouts is explained by the fact that the speculative bubble in the hipster lifestyle sustained false confidence in the ideology of post-politics. Financial and emotional confidence in post-political hipsterdom was still perfectly stable in 2008. Financial and emotional confidence have been lessening steadily since then—the first because of the recession, the second because of the signaling problem befallen authentic counter-culturals within hipsterdom today.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A secondary effect of the stability and satisfaction the occupations provide to the first few hipsters is that it will permit them to draw lines between themselves in the occupations and their former friends in the old hipsterdom. All but the most politically radical have never been able to really draw political lines between themselves and others in American urban centers without choosing a life of isolation on the fringe. Now it is possible to do it with confidence in a political project that does not forgo a large, exciting, social life. This ability to draw lines and burn bridges if necessary will lead to an increasingly clear demarcation between the radical hipsters and the apolitical hipsters. As the occupations pull like magnets the true, authentic counter-culturals out of the hipster bubble, the brightness of the line they will now be capable of drawing between themselves and the post-political will further reinforce the next, final implication.</p></li>
<li><p>The final and most significant implication of an emergent political wing in contemporary hipsterdom exiting the speculative bubble of post-political hipsterdom is that radical politics will once again emerge as an attractive, fashionable lifestyle for young adults. The occupation movement will indeed continue to develop as a national political movement because all of the conditions are in place for a steady resexualization of radical politics in the United States. Two nights ago, the General Assembly of Occupy Philadelphia was deliberating on a high-salience proposal concerning whether to comply with city requests to move location or refuse and prepare to resist eviction. Without having paid too much attention to where in the mass of bodies I placed myself in the assembly, at one point I noticed that to my immediate left and right were all of the hippest-looking and (from my perspective) most attractive occupiers in Occupy Philadelphia. Some of them were groups of friends, but some of them were connected only by the political and essentially socio-sexual bonds of shared youthful exuberance, by the situation of a certain organic, sociological convergence of desires in which I had never before been personally implicated. We were all in favor of resisting eviction, and why wouldn’t we be? We’re young and attractive and fashionable and together: what is more revolutionary? Or consider the emergence of a popular blog entitled “Hot Chicks of Occupy Wall Street: The Sexy Side of Protesting Corruption,” simply photos of beautiful woman, many of whom appear young, hip, and radical.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Everyday moving forward, a few of the old hipsters will catch on and see that radical politics is simply on the rise across the whole horizon of their social lives; they will cease to associate their sexual desire with apolitical DJ culture and the false promises of “indie” and “alt” culture, just as we long ago ceased to associate our political desires with Congress and the false promises of Presidents. We hipsters have been lied to, and we’ve been lying to each other; there is nothing “indie,” “alt,” “counter,” “experimental,” or deserving of the term “hip” in our post-political hipster culture. More and more of us will continue to realize that in more ways than one our post-politics has become a “toxic asset.” Many may join the occupations for what some would call the “wrong reasons,” in other words, just to be cool. That might well be true, but it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Once we are all there, all the conditions that define us, including and indeed especially our unjust and unearned privileges—our level of education, the degree to which our country has betrayed us, our computers and iPhones, our energy—as well as the promises we’ve been made, the futures we’ve been robbed of, and the natural and honest solidarity we will learn to share with the least privileged communities, and not least of all our good looks—all suggest we could very well become the most dangerous political force our dead democracy has ever had to deal with. We won’t be nice like the hippies and we won’t go into hiding like the Weather Underground and we won’t be killed off like the Black Panthers because not even a racist and classist society can tolerate jailing or killing off the whole lot of its defecting progeny.</p>

title: Revolution factories
wordpress_id: 95
categories:</p>

<h2>&ndash; theory</h2>

<p>In the industrial era, factories were physical sites of long-term and repeated interaction among laborers the exploitation and alienation of whom was visible for all to see. The camaraderie and sociality of workers in factories was therefore, as the traditional Marxian schema has it, inherently revolutionary. Today, the factories have been shipped off in favor of any and all currently profitable technologies for physically, socially-separated economic productivity. It is no wonder that union density has slowly and steadily declined and no wonder that a popular fight for true political and economic progress beyond capitalism has all but disappeared: literally, there has been nowhere for it to see itself in contrast to the daily subservience to corporate regiments, no relief in which it could be said to physically exist. In this sense, the exportation and disappearance of the factory was critical in the solidification of what Marcuse has diagnosed as our “one-dimensional” life of post-industrial capitalism.</p>

<p>The consequence of the exportation and disappearance of factories is that we have been forced to replace them with new factories; the consequence of having no capital, no resources, and no futures is that the new factories have no raw materials and no production plans, and thus will be terribly unprofitable. In fact, the new factories do not even have enough resources to produce unprofitable commodities. The new factories, having nothing to produce for non-profit, let alone profit, cannot help but begin dialectically to accumulate a sort of anti-profit. And in this accumulation, we trace our anti-profit backwards to find a sort of hidden reserve of anti-capital, a repressed anticapitalism.</p>

<p>We shipped away the material factories in favor of distributed cyberfactories, and now in that great drama of unintended consequences once upon a time known as the dialectical materialism, the proletariat of the cyberfactories—we the educated and savvy technomads with no jobs, no future, and student debt we can’t even take seriously anymore—have occupied our virtual workplaces and through them produced some good old-fashioned physical factories open to all, factories that have nothing left to produce but revolution itself.</p>

<p>In _One-Dimensional Man_, Marcuse discusses how revolutionary desire always seems to be thwarted by the perception that modern society “delivers the goods,” that we do not find, as in the traditional Marxian eschatology, the immiseration of the masses that makes them rise up but rather provision of the minimal required satisfactions that prevent them from rising up. However, during times when the status quo does not deliver the goods, and precisely to the degree the goods don’t arrive, there is always an natural condition for the emergence of political protest. That much is obvious. What is less obvious is that rather than just resist “austerity” measures that cut funding for vital goods, as in traditional demonstrations or rallies, an occupation itself delivers vital goods. Food is an obvious example. Three meals a day, for free, out of nothing other than crumbs from the table of the most wildly productive organization of society ever evolved. In fact, the occupations are actively delivering other equally essential human goods that the status quo has failed to deliver for so long that most people don’t even know they have been longed starved of them: the need for social relations irreducible to profit. Someone who works with an occupation for even three days cannot help but realize the absolutely astounding and almost unbelievable fact that they are practicing something they literally have never done before, and that that practice is nothing short of and perhaps even nothing more than free, disalienated social interaction. At this point in time, friendships, families, the overwhelming bulk of almost all social relationships that exist in our world are thoroughly mediated and limited by at least arbitrary and at worst viciously unjust distributions of resources material and mental, resources that have been distributed through rather easily traceable historical processes completely alien to any choice or will of our own.</p>

<p>It seems almost obvious that a true and free social relationship can only be that which exists between two or more individuals who together choose and will to relate with one another. But it is equally obvious that most of us have no such relationships, most of our relationships being an accidental function of education, geography, the workplace, race, class, etc. Only within these already historically determined distributions of bodies do we pretend to choose our associates, and even this choice is increasingly determined by sometimes obviously and awkwardly strategic concerns of maximizing material well-being, again subordinate to imperatives outside our choosing.</p>

<p>For instance, two young professionals on their first date will not hestitate to warmly share with one another that they are looking for a partner with a good job, at least $40,000 annually perhaps, not much, modest, but no not ashamed to admit a desire for security, respectable security, can be a teacher or something like that, don’t need a lawyer you know, just educated though, and cleanliness, you know, not about money really, don’t really even care about the money per se, just a good, reasonable life,_etcetera etcetera_. These are not outrageous thoughts, living as we do in a truly frightful, insecure and otherwise disgusting world. What is outragous and truly frightening is that each of these two individuals, if they make more than $40,000 annually, are educated, are clean, and otherwise seem to fulfill the expectations that are usually associated with a $40,000 annual income, will tend to go home feeling warm and fuzzy, feeling lucky and hopeful for the possibility of having found a potential match for lifelong companionship. What claptrap! How have we come to the point at which the kind of absolutely shameless, naked self-interest required for reducing four billion possible companions to one individual by the basic criteria of a few sociological traits associated with income is enough to genuinely make someone love and feel loved, is enough to seriously pass as a true human relationship?</p>

<p>Just last week at Occupy Philadelphia, a couple married at the occupation site, a couple who had met only two weeks prior while working in the occupation. This was the object of not a few jokes I heard outside of the occupation, but what cannot be realized by those who are not yet occupying is that a sudden taste of personal communion based on truly elective affinities and not predetermined by the normal division of labor and historical distributions of capital is, in fact, exactly what most people have in mind when they speak of “true love.” And we should make no mistake about the stunning predicament we are in today, which is that commodification has so thoroughly permeated social relations that the only space left for truly unalienated communion would have to be one dedicated by design to suspending and reconsidering the whole system of current social relations—that is, a durable, liveable, popular anticapitalism.</p>

<p>This is exactly what the occupations are, still hiding under a sort of bourgeois cloak fitted for decent Americans. Fellow Philadelphia occupier Cindy Milstein speaks of how most of the occupation movement’s attitudes, procedures, and protocols are drawn directly from the anarchist organizing tradition—everything from the chants, protest medics, communal kitchens, mutual aid, rejection of external policing, all the way to our now well-known commitment to direct democracy—while nonetheless every now and then a moderate occupier fears aloud that the movement is being hijacked by radical anarchists!</p>

<p>But the ability to even formulate questions about the difference between true and alienated relationships requires one to abstract from daily investments enough to suspend them in such a decontextualized critical consideration as the one above, and this is overwhelmingly a privilege of considerable education and leisure time. However, a largely unrecognized function of the occupation movement is that those who have been deprived of the educational resources to engage in the “critical theory” of daily life and those who know of no other practical possibility for comparison are all learning it together, now. A homeless woman, member of a class that has learned more stoically than any other how to bear and cope with neglect and abondment, comes to our General Assembly crying in fear that the homeless will be left behind if the occupation gets evicted. What was astounding about this is not that someone was in emotional despair for fear of being left behind; there shouldn’t be anything surprising about that. Rather, this moment, precisely in its naturalness, makes incredible the otherwise everyday fact that typically homeless people don’t cry. To be homeless, on the street, to have nobody, and to not cry—to truly comprehend that a whole class of humans have become capable of the most terrible deprivations without crying—that is a realization sufficient to shake the planet. But it is only possible in a dialectical relationship to the perfectly understandable observation that suddenly a homeless woman is crying for fear of being left behind. The occupations, in providing physical public spaces for the emergence of perfectly natural emotions, exchanges, practices, norms, and habits, functions as a revolutionary relief—in both senses—for comprehending the lack of of these emotions, outside of the occupation sites, as simply absurd and intolerable.</p>

<p>This is why the occupation movement is inherently revolutionary, and completely unlike the traditional mass rally or demonstration. The bourgeois rally or demonstration as the exercise of a temporary, spatially constrained, exercise of self-righteous delight on some specific moral high-ground of one’s choosing, a nominal protest which sometimes serves specifically to render excusable and endurable the countless acts of mundane exploitation we engage in for the rest of the month. An occupation reverses this bourgeois formula: it is a temporally indefinite and spatially expandable attempt to suspend the countless practices of mundane exploitation that define the everyday life of the city, a suspension which permits sporadic glimpses at what disalienated social freedom might look like. What is crucial, what makes this function legitimately revolutionary, is that these glimpses, when they truly occur, are positively traumatic—in their true form they are sufficient for overturning years of normalized oppression. From these glimpses there is no return. The police could successfully repress every one of the thousand occupations, but today, for the true occupier of the contemporary American city, there will not be any buses going home.</p>

<p>What I have here elaborated as a sort of traumatic glimpse is, in some sense, akin to what in the Marxian register is known as “class consciousness.” A certain critical moment and necessary condition for revolution at least in the industrial period, class consciousness is typically understood as the realization of workers that they together are the true producers of value and that if the workers stand together they will be strong enough to overthrow those who exploit them. This moment of consciousness is understood as a sort of trigger which, when pulled, is an irreversible and unignorable motive force propelling the workers to seize power. Generations of very smart people have debated the meaning of this term, and I have no interest in situating my remarks in that context. As Marx himself says, “let the dead bury the dead.” The connection is only worth mentioning insofar as it suggests how the present insurrection effectively performs functions, at least in the context of post-industrial, postmodern American urban centers, that have loomed quite large in the revolutionary tradition.</p>

<p>A major problem in the Marxian conception of class consciousness is that even when workers attain “class consciousness,” the good old dues ex machina that is the historical dialectic sometimes sputters out. Turns out, it’s not an automatic trigger. Only theorists can believe that one powerful realization over coffee in the morning can be enough to overturn capitalism. However, building from the Marxian insight, what the occupation movement contributes to the revolutionary tradition is the wager that class consciousness is not a dialectical moment in a historical process, but is itself a dialectical process in the very production of a history. Interestingly, it is the famed French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu who has most significantly departed from Marx mainly in his emphasis on the durability of ideology in practical embodiment, in the dominance of relatively stable, inert sets of habits or habitus. His work has demonstrated how naive was Marx’s personal eschatology of imminent revolution, and in a certain sense the occupation movement can be understood as having understood this lesson. If the occupations are, _inter alia_, sites for the repeated production of traumatic glimpses indefinitely over time, then in a certain sense they can very reasonably be conceptualized as revolution factories, both in the sense that they replace the industrial factory as focal point for revolutionary organizing, and in the sense that they are long-term apparatuses for the production and distribution of revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Thus, the occupation sights are nothing short of revolution factories. The inputs are living beings long reduced to subhuman working conditions, beings the political voice of whom has been slowly and surely reduced to nearly nothing, beings who are culturally and physically malnourished. The occupations provide vital goods of which the modern economy has starved us, and the only price the occupations exact is participation according to the rules and protocols which have evolved as the most radically and sustainably democratic. In other words, one learns to be radical just by occupying, one becomes an anticapitalist, an anarchist, a communist, just by occupying, all while fearing that radicals might hijack the movement!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It is difficult to write of a present insurrection. Journalize, polemicize, moralize, historicize, predict? Considered individually, all traditional modes of reflecting on politics seem insufficient or inappropriate. Someone once said that humans make their own history but not any history they please, so rigorous attention must be paid to the empirically knowable horizons of material, intellectual, and technological possibility. But if we insist on a different future, a future that is truly a future, a future not reducible to current perceptions of the possible, then writing of the present must dare to speculate, hope, or even predict, if only as rhetorical actions that are sometimes capable of producing possibilities that really never even existed to justify such projections in the first place! I have no problem with prophecies if they are of the self-fulfilling variety. Narratives of current substantive and tactical cleavages within the occupation movement are sometimes worth considering, but run the risk of fetishizing very narrow issues in a drama of personalities and factions. For instance, although they are important and were fascinating for a while, who today can read without yawning the endless internal polemics of something like the First International? Needless to say, all current mainstream journalism has been a laughable failure in transmitting to the general public even a hint of the revolutionary beginnings that are perfectly palpable to many of us. Even much journalism contesting the mainstream media outlets still conforms to their conventions and expectations, if only to effectively circulate in the channels of perception already thoroughly deformed by dominant media. Finally, it is perfectly obvious that universities will not permit anyone within the academy to attempt any truly honest and creative intellectual contribution to our present situation, at least not with the university’s powers of consecration and dissemination.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the spirit of our present insurrection, I, for one, will take the liberty of working within any and all of these modes whenever I please and as the situation requires. I am proud to do so while active with Occupy Philly and the contingent of occupiers active on the campus of Temple University, and unfortunately, at no small cost to the dissertation I should be writing at this very moment. I encourage everyone else to take similar liberties wherever and whenever they find them: perhaps the most radical significance of the present insurrection already is that we suddenly have in the public consciousness a certain pretext, a basis of real, honest, radical energy that the general public not only knows about but vaguely supports, however inchoate it might be, which can justify an infinity of exercises in radical self-emancipation. As a thinker, it suddenly feels possible to raise the question of revolution, in the context of post-industrial American politics, without sounding arbitrary, naive, and stupid—even if one still sounds a little crazy. And to develop my powers and interests in a freely self-determined fashion. If nothing else, the occupation movement now provides a public political context for any number of such self-emancipating liberties, behaviors which in turn spread and augment the intensity of the movement. In short, under the banner of our occupation movement it is possible to speak and act in ways one might have always desired but have always felt unable to execute (on account of that little feeling that always tells us, “No, it just wouldn’t come off correctly…).” Today, we are in the midst of an insurrection that is known by the general public well enough—while understood poorly enough—that an infinite range of the writing, speaking, and action we’ve always thought about exploring is not only feasible, but is itself an active contribution to building and intensifying the present insurrection.</p>

<p>For instance, a shout from the rooftop no longer needs to be metaphorical. This evening at 2 a.m. I will literally shout from my rooftop “A better world is possible,” for no other reason than the fact that a better world is possible, that others should know it, and that the old expression always struck me as rather beautiful. But beautiful fancies such as these are typically outlawed by a certain prohibition of optimism. Three months ago, a neighbor hearing me might have awoken, cursed the crazy youth, and gone right back to sleep. So I never would have done it. Tonight, they might do the same thing, but the difference is they’ll have to chalk it up to what they&rsquo;re hearing on the news, what everybody knows is in the air; they&rsquo;ll wonder why they never would have heard such a message from my roof three months ago, and now it will take them a few extra minutes to fall back asleep. By seizing on the infinite range of micropolitical activity opened up by the symbolic omnipresence of a revolutionary movement, we not only have sensible grounds for pushing outward on the emancipation of ourselves, we literally build, extend, and intensify the movement in doing so.</p>

<p>Frantz Fanon says somewhere that at a certain point “methods devour themselves.” That sounds very pleasant to me; we should let them devour themselves. And so with respect to my methodology for reflecting on the movement now well underway, more and more I am realizing that preliminary remarks are no longer necessary.</p>

		<p>A short story by Anne Malkovich Malkovich and me.</p>

<p>* </p>

<p>             As a 28-year-old independent female, I’ve never until now had any need for a car. Having lived in the city my whole life, I’ve always used public transportation and my bicycle and that’s always been good enough. But now that I’m out of college and I now have a real job outside of the city, my parents and I agreed that it was time to get a car.  I studied English Literature with a focus on twentieth-century British literature but my dad knew a guy in the search-engine optimization business so he helped me get a job doing that. Pay is good, great benefits, I get to be on the internet all day, and I get to use my degree because I’m basically a writer (I write and rewrite and edit articles about certain keywords to help websites show up on searches).</p>

<p>            When I went ahead and bought a used car, my mother said I needed to find a noter republic to note for the government or whatever that the title is now in my name, to really make the car mine. So I Googled “noter republic” and found several listings for “notary public,”  which seemed okay, but the last listing on the first page was for a legitimate “noter republic,” so I chose that one. I never really liked “public” things like public pools or public bathrooms. Just always felt more like a republican. I looked at the Google Map displaying all the places and chose the one noter republic, which, conveniently, was near my new job. It was called Abraham D. Brown, who is a mobile Notery Signing Agent, handling all of your Mobile Notery needs—from real estate purchases and refinances to verifications and depositions. No worries, they come to you. But I thought it was weird, the idea of them coming to me, like I would have to let them in my house or something? Why? Awkward. So when I called to make an appointment I asked if I could just go to them and they said “No worries, you can come to us.”</p>

<p>            When I pulled up to the address I was surprised to be at a trailer park. I felt like noter republics should not be within trailer parks. I felt that trailer parks were not really republics. I went up to the mobile home that was the noter republic I found on Google and knocked, rattling the screen door. The screen was half on, half off the door.</p>

<p>            The man who opened the door was really awkward and geeky but extremely attractive. He was wearing high-wasted khaki shorts like a geek. But he kind of looked like he was one of the three people to have been given the title of &ldquo;Sexiest Man Alive&rdquo; twice by <em>People Magazine</em>, first in 1997 and again in 2006, like he appeared in commercials outside the US for products like Fiat, Nespresso and Martini vermouth, and has lent his voice to a series of Budweiser ads beginning in 2005. He looked like he was named one of <em>Time</em> magazine&rsquo;s 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2007, 2008, and 2009. It almost looked like <em>South Park</em> creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker lampooned him among other stars, in their feature film <em>Team America: World Police</em>, like he later maybe said that he would have been offended if he hadn&rsquo;t been made fun of in the film. He sort of looked like he was also mentioned in the South Park episode &ldquo;Smug Alert!&rdquo;, which mocks his acceptance speech at the 78th Academy Awards or something like that.</p>

<p>            When he said hello and asked me how I was doing he spoke with a stutter. He seemed very scared. When he looked at me he noticed I was also wearing high-wasted khaki shorts and really correctly-chosen shoes that make my ankles look pretty even though I’m 75 lbs. over what the National Institute of Health says is average and my face is kind of large and flowing with smushy features. He thought I looked very well put-together, because I was. I always am. I’m not blessed with good looks so I “dress to impress” and I do. Impress, that is. I’m also decently well-read in the humanities and can carry a short-to-medium-length conversation about a modest range of literary trivia.</p>

<p>            When we moved from the door to the table in his mobile notery home I noticed an incomprable grace of movement as he glided effortlessly across the laminate floor, as if he were more influential in the social networking sphere than Barack Obama or The Dalai Lama. It was as if according to Jan Hoffman of <em>The New York Times</em>, part of his appeal stemmed from his YouTube channel. One might have thought that long before he released his EP, My World, in mid-November, the YouTube videos attracted millions of views and someone named Braun recognized the appeal. I almost felt that prior to flying him to Atlanta, Braun might have wanted to &ldquo;build him up more on YouTube first&rdquo; and had Abraham record more home videos for the channel. I imagined that he might have said: &lsquo;Abraham, walk from the door to the table like there’s no one in the room. But let&rsquo;s not use expensive cameras.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that they feel like it&rsquo;s theirs.” I imagined in my head, which was now furiously spewing the most creative and far-fetched possibilities, that he continued to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly; that his account was reported in November 2010 to have over 6 million followers; that since then he has been consistently gaining followers at an average of 24,000 per day; that the accounts also serve marketing purposes; for example, that he has a music video for a song called &ldquo;No Worries, We Come to You,&rdquo; which only began selling quickly after it was uploaded to YouTube.</p>

<p>            “I’m Abraham,” he said, “What’s your name?”</p>

<p>            “I’m Hagar, nice to meet you, Abraham,” I said.</p>

<p>            I looked around the mobile home and it was small and chintzy, covered with myriad colored fabrics to hide the sad-looking wood-looking paneling, but all in all, the place was okay.</p>

<p>            “How can I help you?” he asked.</p>

<p>            “Well, I just bought a used car and the former owner signed the title over to me and my mother told me to bring it to a noter republic. So if  you could just, like, do whatever you do for that… I’d appreciate it,” I said.</p>

<p>            “Oh, um,” he said, “I haven’t had a customer in a while, or, actually, like, ever, I guess. You see, um,” he said, pausing and looking at his high-wasted khaki shorts, “OK, so this, uh, ‘noter republic’ thing was really just a way for me to buy my own mobile home and write it off as a business purchase to save on my taxes. That’s why I spelled it so stupidly, so nobody would find me on Google. It was the only way I could move out of my parents’ mobile home a few lots down that way,” he said, pointing North. He looked at her and thought she was supremely well-dressed with her high-waisted khaki shorts and then he looked at his own and felt awkward but okay, like maybe her style spilled over onto his own shorts or something.</p>

<p>            I felt silly for a second and then I felt like I had fallen out of the solar system that makes sense and landed in a trailer park that was outside of the solar system my mother was in, the solar system that made sense. He was very attractive, surprisingly attractive.</p>

<p>            “Well, why don’t we just Google what it takes to do notary public?” I proposed, emphasising the syllables and pausing between words. “And then you can just do it, I’ll pay you, I get my title, and we all win.”</p>

<p>            “Um, uh, OK, I guess we can do that,” he said.</p>

<p>            “Wait, first, you don’t have a cigarette, do you?” I asked.</p>

<p>            “No, sorry, all I have is my corn-cob pipe,” he replied, pulling it out and beginning to prepare it.</p>

<p>            “Oh, OK, that’s all right,” I said, adding: “Where is your computer?”</p>

<p>            “Oh, um, uh, I don’t have one,” he said. He thought she was very beautiful and he felt very awkward but happy that she was there.</p>

<p>            “You don’t have one?!” I said.</p>

<p>            “No, but my parents do have one. Maybe we could go use it?” he said, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>            “OK, sure, if they are OK with that,” I said.</p>

<p>            “Well, what I’m thinking is hopefully they are asleep so we can just go there and use their computer without having to talk to them. They are old and pretty retarded but their mobile home is bigger and nicer than mine,” he said.</p>

<p>            “Oh, OK. Hey, how old are you, Abraham?”</p>

<p>            “Forty-nine,” he said. “Let me give them a call and if they don’t pick up they are asleep and when they are asleep they <em>do not</em> wake up for anything.”</p>

<p>            He opened a drawer in the kitchen and pulled out what looked to me like one of the phones in that series of cellular telephones manufactured by Motorola, Inc. from 1983 to 1994. It looked like it was one of several different models, plus newer models under the Classic and Ultra Classic names, in the first line of cell phones commercially produced by Motorola, with the first member of the DynaTAC series, the 8000x, being the first cell phone to receive U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) acceptance in 1983. His parents did not pick up and he looked at me like I was really well-dressed and he liked it and I liked it.</p>

<p>            When we got to the bigger mobile home it was still kind of small but bigger and still had fake-wood paneling covered with any number of different fabrics. But the fabrics were much less chintzy and, on the whole, it was much more okay. The screen was completely on the door, which made me feel good, sort of proud for Abraham and his parents. He said his parents take painkillers but they are so old and retarded that they can’t keep track and would I like one? He was very attractive. We went on his parents’ computer and started getting sleepy and a little goofy and we ultimately figured out how to do notary public fraud. We did it and it was a pretty bad job and we laughed a lot and touched elbows and hips about six and two times, respectively. That night we fell asleep in his parents’ mobile home for the first of many times to come over the next forty years and all in all it all felt very okay.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ve already become a cop! You&rsquo;re a DJ. Bars are temp agencies that hire short-term cops to repress the revolutionary desire of any potential counterculture by blasting recycled bourgeois nostalgia into everyone&rsquo;s ears all night. Just to keep people drunk and complacent for the petty profits of idiotic philistines who have nothing to offer us other than petty pedestals for accumulating petty cash, social capital, and sexual partners. I think you should quit your job as a cop and become an artist, as I believe you once were; publicly disavow every currently existing institution in the name of truth, freedom, and a better society; and then help us do away with all of this idiocy and start from scratch. If you agree with this I will respect you. If you dismiss this, then I will be forced to conclude that you are a spineless collaborator with no ideas, convictions, or anything else worth expressing. If you respond, then I trust we will have a fruitful dialogue about the culture you and I share. Needless to say, I do not acknowledge your right to make statements on Facebook free of any responsibility to account for them.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2011/08/29/9537176228/" itemprop="url">About the truth of pop music</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If I understand him correctly, musician and theorist John Maus argues that the way of listening called music can be brought forth universally through the core procedure of pop, which, to him, is the process of abstracting away from music all “concentrations” or particularities of its contingent production and enjoyment (namely, standardization, materialization, and multiplication).</p>

<p>According to Maus, the pop musicians R. Stevie Moore and Ariel Pink represent a tradition of pop music that approaches the singular truth of pop through an excessive enactment of its protocols. For instance, R. Stevie Moore’s song “You are True” is “too much a pop song,” representing an excess that commercial capitalism cannot integrate.</p>

<p>The identification and elaboration of a subversive current in the pop tradition is exciting and probably true, but the recent celebration of Maus and the so-called truth of pop hides an elephant on the other side of pop-music’s very large room. Namely, what is the profane truth of commerically successful mainstream pop music, capable of producing in the masses a sometimes ecstatic or almost religious satisfaction but specifically not excessive, not distruptive?</p>

<p>If Maus is interested in what we might call the <em>ecstatic</em> or <em>sacred</em> truth of pop, then the <em>profane</em> truth of pop music is its paradoxical serenity, which is peculiarly capable of immobilizing and inuring the listener at the same time that within the context of present social conditions and contemporary “post-political” ideology it tends to produce only one specific desire other than for the eternal recurrence of the song itself: for the commodity, the saleable good or service that will be provided to the buyer granted the buyer has enough money, i.e. the only human lack that pop-music seems capable of not completely obfuscating or concealing in the name of our contented enjoyment. The wedding of modern advertising and pop music is only the most obvious example of the marked ideological consistency between pop music and the fetishism of commodities. I would just like to bear out these claims. I begin with an anecdote.</p>

<p>* </p>

<p>Sitting in a café, having just finished a cup of coffee, I read the following sentence from Rachel Annand Taylor’s Leonardo the Florentine: “Among his flowering perfections there creeps that suggestion not only of the bizarre but of the monstrous. At one or two disconcerting moments one feels that Leonardo, indifferent at heart as the “Nature” of his devotion, is, like her, capable of communicating a horror incomprehensible to those who love humanity, the species that is at once her prince and irrevocable enemy.” I instantly fill with giddy excitement and immediately decide to go home and work. But there is song playing on the radio, quite a good song for radio pop, I think to myself, whith a female voice incanting variants of:</p>

<p><em>I tried to do handstands for you</em>
<em>but everytime I fell for you,</em>
<em>I’m permanently black and blue,</em>
<em>permanently blue for you you-ooh-ooh-ooh</em></p>

<p>I pack my things and go home.</p>

<p>Returning home in frenzied inspiration, I awake my computer from its nap and open a document I’m working on. But I recall the song that played on the radio at the café and I quickly download it. I play this pop song that seems especially nice to me. I still feel great, but before I know it 45 minutes have elapsed and I have not even looked at, let alone worked on, my document, while the male in the duo softly sings:</p>

<p>_I grabbed some frozen strawberries so I could ice your bruising knees
But frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste like….
All those frozen strawberries I used to chill your bruising knees,
Hot July ain’t good to me
I’m pink and black and blue for you._ </p>

<p> * </p>

<p>The song is entitled “Bruises.” The song is by a band called Chairlift. Interestingly, Chairlift was an indie band with some underground credibility when Apple Computers chose this very song for the commercial introducing the 4th-generation iPod Nano. A difficult question, one probably impossible to answer definitively: Why did Apple choose this song from an unknown indie band? Businesses do nothing at random; that they perhaps used focus groups begs the question of why <em>this song</em> of all songs. If the consistency between advertising and its music is a convenient index of the ideological core of pop music, then this question serves as a heuristic for delineating the truth of profane pop music. To understand why this song fits so seemlessly with, of all things, the iPod Nano, would be at once to understand the structuring logic of “successful” mainstream pop music.</p>

<p>* </p>

<p>In <em>Saint Genet</em>, Jean-Paul Sartre writes, “If you have only a crumb that has fallen from the table, your life will be spent in defending that crumb, in convincing others and yourself, in convincing others and yourself that it is the best of crumbs and that, in the last analysis, it contains the universe. Genet has nothing, which amounts to saying that he has an eminent right over everything. At this point there begins the systematic turning of the positive into the negative and the negative into the positive which later, carried to an extreme will lead Genet to ‘saintliness.’ In the ‘land of Chimeras,’ a conversion of signs is sufficient to change penury into wealth.”</p>

<p>Today, is the problem for capital not something like the inverse of Genet’s? That is, do we consumers not already have everything, giving us a right over nothing? This, then, as a guess, is perhaps the ultimate truth of pop music: to furnish desire for a population who already has everything and therefore possesses a right to nothing, to furnish this right, in other words. For, in the land of Chimeras a conversion of signs is also sufficient to change wealth into penury.</p>

<p>* </p>

<p>How does pop music do this and, by way of the heuristic with which the analysis opened, is there evidence of precisely this logic exceptionally at work in the song already considered? Actually listening to R. Stevie Moore, as John Maus suggests, is unsettling and almost intolerable insofar as he exceeds and therefore violates the conventions defining the enjoyment of pop music. R. Stevie Moore makes one want to do better or at the very least do something else simultaneously; that which unsettles in R. Stevie Moore is perhaps what Sartre somewhere calls the “springboard of negativity,” the messy, ugly half of human creativity that most “right-thinking” bourgeois artists conceal but is precisely what drives work toward the “good,” the “beautiful,” etc.  As I listen to the infinitely charming pop song about doing handstands, I am so content that it is impossible to even want to do anything else.</p>

<p>This song is perhaps exceptional, is perhaps the perfect 21st century pop song and thus the ideal song for the iPod Nano commercial, because it does not even allow the listener the traditional object of desire to which pop music traditionally directed our fantasies. Namely, the duo of lovers both seem to love each other and yet they are for completely unknown reasons _still black and blue . _The song offers no conflict but nonetheless gets away with the vague impression of lack, a suffering, a completely unknown problem. The only contender in sight is gravity or clumsiness which are perhaps thwarting the poor girl’s handstands. We are forced to affirm either the literality of the handstand problem or else admit that this song is able to create a sense of loss despite the absence of any real problem in the world. Is this not exactly the kind of music that an advertising executive might pray for? Perhaps that is the profane truth of pop music.</p>

<p>Rustica is simply the best godd<em>mn place any second on this planet. I just ate a godd</em>mn buffalo chicken sicilian jigger for only $3, which is without a doubt the best pound-for-pound dollar-for-dollar thing to eat anywhere on this terrible website. It made me so f<em>cking happy I decided to sign up for this embarrassingly stupid website. It made me feel like I could be happy every second of every day just from once eating this thing that only cost $3; I was there all by myself, eating, and I just burst out laughing like a maniac. If you don’t go here every godd</em>mn day you are a maniac. A little girl was pointing up at the sign that says Rustica above the front door saying to her mommy how she liked it and I told her that I was the one who designed it, and I was! That’s how happy this place makes me every godd*mn day.</p>

<p>This place is so bad that to me the core of the consumer experience is that I would never even think about going to this place unless I was really thirsty/hypnotized, which I might be one day, but not today or ever right now. Judging by the fashion of the people who go here and the quality of the storefront—which I designed, by the way, today, in Photoshop, to make it less intolerably offensively poorly-designed—this place is overpriced, boring, and induces severe anxiety/fear for the nature/future of humanity.</p>

<p>This is the best bar and DJ house any f*cking minute of my life, any hemisphere since the Golden Age of ancient Greek civilization; I will recount everything that ever happened here to explain how good it is. Once when I was in college in 2004 I didn’t know places/things, I went there and felt it was exotic/scary/tattoos so then I got tattoos. I did not have intimacy that night (a morally dubious thing to say but this is the core of the consumer experience at this establishment, what the yelp guidelines ask for). Sometime after that I once danced with a girl for 60 minutes on/off and it seemed clear that we liked each other and I almost had intimacy that night but we only kissed, which is not intimacy but rather is typically perceived to be a clarion call for an intimacy that is imminently on the horizon so to speak. Then I remember I went back years later after I had found myself and I just immediately felt at home in this safe haven that now features two different barbaries, one for foodies and people who don’t like to pay covers (upstairs/barbarella), one for people who like to pay 3-5 dollars 2-7 nights per week to get photographed by facebook (downstairs/barbary regular). That one night after I had found myself already and was really at home here, that night I had intimacy. Some people think its awkward when you see someone at the barbary after you only had one intimacy with them after the barbary but I don’t think it is. I think at some places it might be like that but it never is for me at the barbary. A new room on top of the upstairs was just released, this is mysterious/will probably go there soon, you should too. Think that probably there is a nuclear-bomb-shelter in the basement where the owner/employees/photographers/DJs/most-photographe d-people will go if there is ever nuclear war and they will keep an “underground” facebook that holds all the photography archives to be released after the war to kind of like “repopulate” the scene for the third barbary because, as some reviewers have already mentioned, the barbary is currently on its second life.</p>

<p>I honestly think what happened here was it used to be cool among white hipsters on Thursday nights when they played 90s hip-hop and then many black people and bro’s started going and now it is not cool among white hipsters. I’m willing to be corrected if this is not a fair description of this establishment’s evolution, but this is honestly what I remember observing as a decently well-educated roughly socially-aware member of the white hipster community. I don’t think any of my friends / anyone in my dating pool really goes here anymore and like, nothing else cool or interesting I know of really happens here, so the core of my consumer experience here is that it is irrelevant to my life at this point in time.</p>

<p>Has dance party called Banana Chips, this fake Mexican restaurant for white people who prefer white people to eating so much really good/cheap Mexican food nearby. Feel like they have parlor games like foosball which I’ve played before and it was fun. They have so many TVs it’s completely godd*mn bonkers no wonder people go upstairs and pay to get into Banana Chips, which I feel like is comparable to Sorted (@ Barbary) in terms of quality/attractiveness/fashion of patrons, but is probably dumber/worse, although I’ve never gone to it. To make this review even more confusing but honest, I feel like they have hosted 8-75 hardcore music shows before. Like, wtf is this place?</p>

<p>First to Review
Was good as a spaghetti warehouse then it became the worst venue ever considering it’s never even had one godd<em>mn show. R5 really botched the job on this one: I went here a week ago to get spaghetti under really f</em>cking bright lights while listening to sh<em>tty radio pop music blasted in my dingus ears all f</em>cking night but it was closed because R5 bought it and R5 don’t know sh<em>t about spaghetti or warehouses. So I went back a week later to see a R5 show cuz it beats the sh</em>t out of radio pop blasting in your face while you’re trying to eat Pop’s Lasagna or whatever the godd*mn dish was called (RIP) but, lo and behold, no shows have ever been put on here so my first thought was that this place blows, gets one star, I’m hungry, break my life into pieces, this my last resort, yelp!, etc.</p>

<p>But then I read an exceptional piece of contemporary journalism in the Philadelphia Weekly, which I wish I could review on here but I can’t, and I learned that Union Transfer is the godd*amn best thing to ever happen to music in Philadelphia or anywhere else in the whole scheme of human history other than Bookspace. So the core of my consumer experience started off weak/terrible but is now and into the future just nothing short of Tiger Woods golf-quality, which is to say damn near perfect except when it sucks which is rare.</p>

<p>A failed diner that found success through a very clever change of business plan: hiring freelance hipsters to turn it into a local hipster bar and it largely succeeded with flying colors and now it makes mad bank probably and vegan cheesesteaks and “tots.” They very wisely hired the (cool, nice) kinda older hip dude who bartends (or used to bartend, idk) at Bob and Barbara’s and Ray’s and now attractive young people are in there all the time and it’s fantastic. Very generous happy hour, impossible to talk/hear your friends any time of any night given that DJs are f<em>cking bombarding your ears, nice outdoor seating with heaters, and if you get really drunk there and get tired of having your ears destroyed and you feel like an idiot for eating so much seitan you can walk two doors down and do kareoke at Connie’s Ric Rac or just go home on Facebook because the internet is honestly, seriously the best place to express yourself ever invented, like it makes Guttenberg look like a f</em>cking piece of child. Feel like the older hip dude they hired should inherit the place when Teri, like, quits or whatever. Feel like he “did all the work,” and is totally completely responsible for the success of that place. Feel like hipsters are exploited by older people who just use hipsters for their ability to draw crowds and all the profits go to f*cking normies you would never even think about dancing/kissing/intimacy with if they ever actually went to the place you go to and yet you are willing to essentially pour money down their pants, like seriously wtf is wrong with us are we idiots or just drunk / love karaoke too much. But aside from their structural role in the exploitation of hipsters for profit, the owners/manager people are pretty nice cool/too and the older hip dude who is responsible for all the success is cool so this place is great all around.</p>
