	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>To take these introductoy comments seriously is to unlock a whole new orientation for scientific research never before accessed by serious institutionalized scientific “disciplines,” especially the currently prevailing sciences of society. This present work is in no sense “interdisciplinary.” Rather, it is militantly anti-disciplinary, anti-_discipline _for that matter, and by scientific necessity. Moreover, what is at stake in this pursuit is a practical project of reconstituting that chain of speech, truth, and being—a chain of which Socrates is perhaps only the purest representative—which is the key to the history and fall of critical thought. Consequently, this work cannot be anything other than a gift in the strict sense, an expenditure without reserve, in friendship with the friendless, and an opening salvo against all the intellectual moneychangers, against all false friends everywhere. As such, it is also a call to philosophic and scientific arms, directed first and foremost to my peers, the young and privileged and educated, we who still have a choice between producing false truths to earn petty comforts in a thoroughly false society, or defecting in favor of a radically emancipated honesty absolutely opposed to every currently existing institution. Needless to say, the latter course won’t pay because it is strictly priceless or, what is the same, _worthless_. The only personal rewards we can expect are the clarity and dignity of poverty, and if we make it, an actual intellectual community. It’s happened once or twice before. But it is only by betraying the betrayers that we might one day soon meet on such a plane of new beginnings, the plane of honest philosophy and honest science.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>“Whatever needs to be maintained through force is doomed.” – Henry Miller</p>

<p>The political implications at this point in our exposition are an almost absurd combination of obvious and radical. The most important implication of the present framework is that it unites the aim of social science (demonstrable causal explanations of empirical phenomena) with the aim of political philosophy (demonstrable explanations of what is good or just). This is because everything indicates that the concept of equilibrium in scientific modeling has more than an etymological commonality with the concept of <em>equality</em> in political philosophy. The philosophical value of equality has little to do with any historical state of nature, any original situation, or any traditionally positive, “true” philosophy of human nature whatsoever. As we have demonstrated, humanity and its history could not have emerged from anything but some flux of random inorganic inequality in a cosmic version of what social scientists would call “short-run” disequilibrium. Rather, equality is an absolute ontological <em>tendency</em> of all things—the nature of things <em>in the long run.</em> When a theorist as honest as Rousseau finds a justificatory key for the philosophical defense of human equality in a “state of nature,” it is not that he’s wrong; he only fails to specify the exact character of this theoretical finding. The state of nature is not where humans or anything else came from but where humanity and all things return after all the false, contingent, institutional props are removed. Given our methodological reliance on circularity as the structure of existence, it’s easy to see there is hardly any difference between where everything comes from and where all things return. The very point is that the definition of existence over time is <em>going back to where it came, _the “it” being nothing more than the negative space between going and returning. Rousseau’s path is very much our own, so long as we insist on the caveat that the original state of nature only </em>becomes_ the true human origin as the <em>destination</em> of all honest human thought and action.</p>

<p>The path we have taken establishes human equality not first and foremost as a moral or ethical value to be debated indefinitely—as traditional, institutionalized philosophy has always done—but as a necessary condition for philosophy and science itself. Because even the bourgeois conception of truth is unconditionally inconsistent with bias, and we have shown that any intellectual movement other than pure Socratic negativity is biased in any institutionalized status quo, nothing that wants to be truly true, philosophically or scientifically, can even proceed in the absence of absolute equality between all things, human or otherwise.</p>

<p>For now, it suffices to say that honesty is a project of mapping all things as fully as possible. However, no cute Borgesian tales on the aporias of infinity are required to see that even the fullest possible map of how things function will be unable to include itself on the map. This would only function as an objection to our project if we were asking for permission to play on the plane of truth. Rather, we are on the plane of immanence, the plane of honesty, at the truth of truth, where we neither ask nor give permission. So long as we hold fast to honesty rather than truth, all these bad infinities can be shaken off like a bad dream. Honesty, as we will continue to elaborate it and as we must begin to practice it, is a project that takes the perverse circularity of mere truth as the springboard for honestly unraveling all things everywhere, all texts, obviously, but also all institutions, all milieus, all status quo stabilities at all junctures. This is how the philosopher of today must learn to see all of life as so many layered and interconnected facades that a simple but radical honesty cannot help but performatively bring into relief as absolutely and essentially false.</p>

<p> Barely lifting the lid on things, it is already possible to see how much idiocy we are capable of explaining with one critical method. For instance, how the refrain of “I’m just being honest” is often so dishonest given that society itself is only a systematic funhouse of smoke and mirrors. This popular apology often serves to justify dishonest speech or action by referring to objective reference points as if they were reference points of the true or “real,” whereas it is perfectly clear that “objective” reference points are perfectly arbitrary rest-stops on what is nothing more than a path of routinized contingency. As Henry Miller puts it, “One can be absolutely truthful and sincere even though admittedly the most outrageous liar. Fiction and invention are of the very fabric of life.” The chief characteristic and undeniable value of a corpus such as Miller’s, this mad dreaming of an auto-didacticic Brooklyn boy, is only his refusal to be “true” within the falsity of an American twentieth-century.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if most people don’t become great artists or philosophers, is it not because they possess <em>too much</em> fidelity to the truth? We fail to achieve our glory for being too good, too decent, too truthful. Decent folks see intellectual aporia at the very outset of thought more clearly than intellectuals; they correctly determine that their painting or story or treatise will be unjustifiably partial, somehow, vaguely untrue, inauthentic somehow. So they don’t bother. For the most part, today’s artists and intellectuals are those who, at a sufficiently young age in life, decided they didn’t give a damn about the truth; but that they would seek it nonetheless, if only to spite it.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/09/12/31425089281/" itemprop="url">#15: The Institutionalization of Philosophy as the Repression of Honesty</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It will be noticed that although we determine Truth and truth to be two false, ideological notions, we have opposed to these the third term of <em>honesty.</em> Honesty is human drive in full transparency, which manifests itself as the absolute and outright rejection of all currently existing things. In short, this is because all ensembles are only stabilized contingencies historically leveraged. The human drive, making no assumptions and having no reason to take anything for granted, quickly identifies the baselessness of all currently existing things. We all learn this when, after asking “Why?” three or four times in succession, mommy and daddy tell us to shut up if we want to eat dinner. If honesty acknowledges the legitimacy of nothing other than its own movement, it thus rejects all distinctions, and thus all that is left is the “oneness” of all human drive as ether or vapor or “event” at the edge of any moment in history.</p>

<p>The destination of honesty is thus the ground zero of nothingness, where the movement of skepticism—ineradicable in the history of philosophy—always lands. It is also the plane from which all things are spun, the plane of immanence. The motif of circularity announces itself once again. Because all things, from the atom to “human civilization,” by definition share the same structure of thinghood—but variably separated and distinguished by almost infinite and infinitely diverse evolutionary distributions—it is no surprise that human thought itself has the structure of a thing and that its true conclusions must return to its beginnings: absolute ignorance, and thus the indistinction of all existing things. The absolute indistinction of all existing things clearly implies the illegitimacy of all enforced separations.</p>

<p>Curiously, however, at the same time it serves an especially convenient springboard or foundation for making new things. Precisely because one can show, without fail, that the consistency and separation of anything collapses under scrutiny—this radically pervasive illegitimacy of contingent distinctions in our human world can be mobilized as an all the more convincing justification for some new premise in some now syllogism. As Deleuze and Guattari point out, Descartes’ proof of the cogito, one of the greatest philosophical innovation-thing of the modern period, finds its foundational certitude in the figure of an idiot who thinks and speaks to himself, doubting whether anything exists, including himself. It is easy to see that Husserl—by investing the strong skepticism of modern psychologism into a structure of an all-the-stronger transcendental consciousness, literally and rather transparently does this over again, doing for the idiot of modernism what Descartes does for the idiot of modernity.</p>

<p>This nexus that is at once the destination of honest thought and the source of dishonest but “true” thought is exactly what has been defined as the plain of immanence. As already defined, human thought is the eternal departure and return from and to the plain of immanence.</p>

<p>But the present investigation, by beginning with neither skeptical questioning nor the search for certitude, but existence in general as modeling the movement between the two, now furnishes a particularly stunning comment on the history of philosophy. Our investigation shows that the history of philosophy as an institution cannot help but suffer irredeemably and unjustifiably from a concrete and specifiable bias, and thus a component of systematic <em>falsity</em>. With respect to “truth,” skepticism and antiskepticism are perfectly undecidable. They are two perfectly equivalent things (philosophies) within one institutional ensemble (Philosophy), two equal and opposing movements that balance and constitute each other. This is not only why interpreters with opposite agendas can very well find either component in any particular philosopher. More importantly, it is why philosophy, so long as it refers us to criteria related to “truth”—logic, reason, whatever—suffers from what social scientists call “status quo bias.”</p>

<p>In short, truth is a bribed referee because a tie between the absolute critique of currently existing institutions and the absolute defense of all currently existing institutions will always be decided in favor of the latter, in favor of currently existing institutions. The institutionalization of philosophy is exactly this bribe, society literally paying the radically honest with the right to live and often the right to live comfortably, on condition that they commit to being merely truthful. Was this not exactly the provisional solution of Platonism and the Academy as a response to the crisis of Socrates? And history shows that when such bribed referees depart from the merely true to the honest, their right to live is revoked in proportion to this departure. Some are given hemlock or burned at the stake, others sent from their post at Yale to the University of London.</p>

<p>This also returns us to the alternative metaphorical registers of physics and evolution. We are simply pointing out that in the institution of philosophy, any conceptual innovation—skeptical or antiskeptical—is subject to the laws of “attraction” or “selection.” Skepticism falls to the earth neither more nor less than antiskepticism, but the ideological falsity of the debate lies precisely in the fact that between these two opponents the earth itself was supposed to be at stake! An unbiased, non-ideological social context for philosophy would imply literally earth-shaking, society-wide alterations of human experience during the highwater marks of skepticism and equally strong returns to stability during the highwater marks of antiskepticism. That only a small portion of society experience only minor alterations of perception at any of these junctures, relative to the always-overwhelming gradualism of dynamics in common sense, illustrates how far we are from the seemingly absurd implications of an unbiased social context for philosophy. Similarly, skepticism is neither more nor less “fit” than anti-skepticism, given the institutional context of philosophy, and faces neither more nor less selection pressures. But honesty evolved into “truth” because of selection pressures, selection pressures that are perfectly contingent and unjustified sanctions in favor of the status quo.</p>

<p>By accepting truth as a criterion, honesty pays homage to falsity by marketing itself as a merely true “skepticism,” thus becoming harmless, perfectly balanced and neutralized by an equally true antiskepticism. But in doing so it also becomes essentially dishonest. This is how philosophy as an institution—captured in our running cartoon starring Socrates and Plato—betrays its original impulse, and indeed how institutionalization as such is nothing less betrayal as pure form. Incidentally, this accounts for why the notion of betrayal is loaded with such a fundamental contradiction as that between “showing possession,” and “turning one’s back on.” It is because to earn a socially legitimated ownership of something is strictly tantamount to turning it upside down, submitting it to the ideological inversion that society requires so as to not let any radically honest claim destroy its dishonest essence and foundation.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The chief difficulty of logic stems from the ideological nature of language. Dealing only with truth, with internal consistency, logic models the essence of the thing but not its existence. Its existence can only be modeled by the whole map of it, which means not the image of an air-tight circle floating in space, but a map of the whole ensemble within which it is constituted and constituting and including the word-things of its negative space. This is to say that, pretty obviously, logic has the <em>structure</em> of a fiction. Without any sanction from Truth, logic draws maps that are true and thus ideological. If Socrates is special because he testifies to <em>nothing</em> and is thus made to disappear (he is exceedingly massive or evolutionarily unfit relative to the whole ensemble), analytical philosophy is special because its formalism testifies to <em>everything, _i.e. anything one feels like putting in the place of all those </em>P_s and _Q_s. This first of all serves as an excellent illustration of the difference between honest, radical philosophy and bourgeois, collaborationist philosophy: the difference between producing things in the service of truth as opposed to producing truth in the service of things.</p>

<p>But second of all, conceptualizing the difference between Socratic and analytic philosophy in this manner, is an extremely provocative way to cap on both ends the history of what is called Western civilization. In the figure of Socrates, this history begins with an explosion of intellectual energy the unlimited and relentless nature of which obviously threatened the whole ensemble of falsely constituted “things” on whose backs the Greek polis rose to such clarity. As soon as the radical <strong>honesty</strong> represented by Socrates is betrayed by a Plato, whose endlessly provocative, stimulating, and subversive negotiations with Socrates’ executioners are, nonetheless for all of that, <em>negotiations with executioners</em>. When a teacher gets murdered for being honest and the indignant student’s response is to start an Academy, the jig is up. Everything is in place for that peculiar ensemble of institutions that prides itself on producing so much truth and beauty at the cost of so much dishonesty, murder, slavery and exploitation across the earth. After the Academy, it is not long until we get Aristotle, the syllogism and a thousand and one additional betrayals of the Platonic vision, itself already a betrayal. From there, Western civilization is nothing more than a little bit of primitive accumulation, a few false starts, and then finally the society-wide institutionalization of betrayal: what is called capitalism. Today, lo and behold, at the world-historical height of global capitalism, the discipline of philosophy is dominated by analytical philosophy, where everything that currently exists is true.</p>

<p>Arguably, Plato’s philosophy can be read as an effort to establish and protect a space for radical honesty. Immediately, this would be the function of the Academy. In the longer term, Plato would have radical honesty installed, via the philosopher-king, in the seat of political power itself. So it is not a matter of indicting Plato, for we are all guilty, dwelling in his place halfway between Truth and murder; the point is to see how and why anything other than absolute and revolutionary honesty is betrayal. If philosophy wishes to be anything, it must be a radical honesty that seeks to accelerate all existing things into itself, testifying to the truth of nothing currently existing, effectively chewing up everything in order to make some new ensemble of things; otherwise, it is nothing apart from commerce, just another form of dishonesty and collaboration with all of the past, present, and future horrors taking place across the globe.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>By arriving at ideology and false consciousness, we thereby arrive at the question of truth, a question the history of philosophy has quite impressively muddled up with repressed nervous energy, as we will show.</p>

<p>If we understand Truth to be “that which really is the case” beyond contingent and arbitrary appearances, it becomes perfectly clear according to our model that in some sense, _there is only falsity. _That is, the generation and persistence of things, including maps or ensembles of word-things, cannot escape determination by arbitrary distributions of things across ensembles possessing no other positive sanction than a persistence into which, strictly speaking, they randomly stumbled at every stage. All things are false because every existing thing is only a component in a durable ensemble of things spun from some unknown and unknowable contingent point of a strictly random flux. Of course, all language is equally false because word-things are no more endorsed by anything other than similarly multi-staged but random persistances.</p>

<p>In fact, if what we want from our maps of existence is the map of that which “really” is the case beyond contingent and arbitrary appearances, we must run as fast as we can away from all inherited language, even if we will have no choice but to loop back into it for the purpose of making any sense or having a human audience. For, as we have shown, language from the beginning is not just raised and nurtured throughout every stage of its life by an arbitrary distribution of things, but that the most evolutionarily-fit formations of language—true statements, in other words—will be those that strengthen, flatter, confirm, integrate, i.e. accelerate back toward the ensemble that randomly emits the energy constituting them. Thus, if we are interested in what is “really” the case, almost all language at any point in time is interesting mostly as an index of what is not the case at all. Just as contracts do not represent trust, but testify to a lack of trust. Just as a philosophical “system” does not represent the integrity of a philospher’s thought but testifies precisely to the insufficiency of integrity freely developed. Language, similarly, has never had and could never have the function of capturing or reflecting that which “really” is, but rather it testifies only to that which <em>is</em> fictionally. If language testified to what really is, it would testify to nothing (as in the language of Socrates) and be killed off (as in the fate of Socrates).</p>

<p>However, as we could not help but observe in passing, there certainly seems to exist such a thing as true statements. So long as we understand what is meant by deploying a small <em>t</em>, then of course, truth exists. The thing called truth is best represented in logic. It is a closed system that internally coheres, the syllogism. So long as premises are stated, we can deduce from them implications that are formally, strictly, truly true.</p>

<p>But of course, it is obvious and well-known that the formal truth of logic says nothing of the content of the premises. In other words, the philosophical discipline known as logic—just like evolutionary theory, physics, electrical analysis, and any other discipline we will continue to exhume insofar our investigation continues to both justify and demand it—is just another metaphor for the structure of things, ideologically inflected by its own place in the division of intellectual labor. What is the syllogism other than a closed loop that, as pure form, consists by design in no-_thing_ other than a beginning (major premise) that extends itself (minor premise) only to loop back into itself (conclusion)?</p>

		<p>When it draws a picture of itself on the wall, as buffalo becoming human, it represents one of many distributions of investment possible for the caveman. He is reflecting in <em>leisure time,</em> an intensive good itself only produced by the physical labor of finding and walking into the cave. He simply continues to draw the map of his world, the next lines on the same map he drew across the earth in his footsteps to the cave. But because the lines of snow have been neutralized, effectively erased by the cave as a dwelling, it becomes possible to draw not simply the most simple and urgent maps, of the animal and snow and cave, but rather it is then possible to draw a map of the animal and snow and cave drawing a map. This is done via the plane of immanence with the cave’s wall as canvas. But notice that this artistic abstraction in leisure is not idle play, it is simply the next logical step of human nature as intensive space. For, the most evolutionarily valuable map is always the fullest map, which means the map of all things, including all maps, and so on and so forth. The difficult implication is that the one absolute map is impossible, and the quantitatively greatest map is in no way necessarily the second best. This is because maps, as things, can also be used to produce things. All of this is simply to reveal the inherent openness of evolutionary development as non-teleological and that maps are never just maps but functions. Any map, as a thing, can be used to produce other things.</p>

<p>Thus, the <em>arts and sciences _converge as the work of constructing maps of intensive things via the plane of immanence onto which the human is always falling back to gravitationally, using extensive things as models in leisure. In other words, nothing more or less than </em>non-, extra-, anti-, sub, or supra-institutional_ <em>human life</em>.</p>

<p>Note the true character of art and science with respect to our growing portfolio of unified theories. First of all, clearly, authentic art and science represent defaults without reservation on all debts owed to existence, in order to invest in the production of new models. They are the apples thrown sufficiently high that they reach their own orbit, leaving the original ensemble or force-field which generated them, despite its gravity. They are random mutations—like language—that are in many ways unfit with respect to the prevailing ensemble but create niches in which new traits might thrive despite the dominant ensemble of things and potentially threatening the extinction of that dominant ensemble. Art and science are both illegitimate or_ corrupt<em>, to use a classical term reanimated in some degree by Hardt and Negri, exactly to the degree they pay back the dominant ensemble. If they do not take their own prerogatives absolutely, if they pay for permission in the coin of _homage</em>, they are neither art nor science. The arts and sciences, if they are to be anything, must be everything. Needless to say, they are currently nothing.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><em>XX &amp; XY in bed, lying. Both moderately tall, attractive moderately dark-haired people, roughly 22-26 years old. </em></p>

<p><em>Enter Z, a moderately tall, attractive dark-haired man, roughly 26-years old. He walks to the foot of the bed.</em></p>

<p>Z: Why are you in this bed?</p>

<p>XY sits up.</p>

<p>XY: Good question, I really have no idea. (to no one) Why do we even have it?</p>

<p>XX: (to Z) Why are you in this room? Fuck you.</p>

<p>Z: What!? Why wouldn’t I be? It’s so easy!</p>

<p>XX: (sits up, smiling suddenly) Oh yeah, it’s so obvious! We should just get rid of the bed!</p>

<p>XY: We should definitely get rid of it right now. It’s so obvious.</p>

<p>XX: It’s so easy.</p>

<p>XY: Okay, great. Let’s get rid of it right now.</p>

<p>XX: What should we do with it? (lays back down, solemnly) I hate this bed. I just want to get it out of here. This bed does nothing for me.</p>

<p>XY: It’s so obvious. Let’s just put it on the roof. Then we wouldn’t even have to see it!</p>

<p>XX: But what about when we go on the roof? Then there’d be this dumb bed just staring at us. And when we’re not on the roof, I feel like we’d feel it’s presence coming through the ceiling or something. No, we can’t put it on the roof.</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, there is no reason to do that. That would be the dumbest thing.</p>

<p>XX: Let’s just put a really hard surface on top of the bed. Let’s negate the bedness of the bed.</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, it’s so obvious! Wait, no it’s not. It’d be so hard to find a hard surface.</p>

<p>XX: Yeah, that’d be such a pain in the ass. Granite weighs so much. It’s so stupid.</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, it’s so obvious! Let’s just move out.</p>

<p>XX: Like, abandon the bed? Yeah, that is definitely so obvious!</p>

<p>XY: Yeah, it would be so easy to leave right now. You can basically leave anywhere you want at any time.</p>

<p>XX: But I never want to see a bed ever again. There are going to be beds anywhere we go. I want to completely escape the bed as both a physical object and as a paradigm of bourgeois comfort and pacification.</p>

<p>XY: Really? Are there beds everywhere? I feel like there are never any beds anywhere. Just awake bourgeois people.</p>

<p>XX: Where is a place where there are no beds and no bourgeois people? Let’s go there. It’s so obvious.</p>

<p>XY: I feel like the bed idea is just an excuse to express and present ourselves and to also spend time together doing something “productive,” I think it’s sad we need the bed for that, so we should burn it to prove we don’t need it to write a play.</p>

<p>XY: Feel like “burning the bed” has been a funny/cool idea but just now got a really strong flash of a feeling that I think if you agreed I would maybe literally, really truly light it on fire in my room and maybe burn the house down accidentally. Really, actually felt for one second that I would definitely do that.</p>

<p>XX: Into burning the bed, turning it into an effigy to all the shit that we do not need, the feeling of ‘doing it anyway’ in the face of perhaps not immediately being able to. Re: the bed, we do not need it for the things that we do. Let’s burn it. Really, truly, let’s burn this goddamn bed.</p>

<p>XX: ALSO
I AM FUCKING AMPED UP ON JUICE AND ADDERALL
IS THIS HOW GOD FEELS??????????</p>

<p>XX: I FEEL LIKE APHRODITE AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IS MY BOW</p>

<p>XY: I think I have \~6 Word documents open, all of which I just started. I am so glad you are not in my room, but I am so glad that you are alive. I am so glad that you are a breathing, pulsing, desiring, knowing and unknowing being who is not in my room this minute but is aliving.</p>

<p>XX: I think the number of tabs I have open on my computer is directly related to the number of drugs I have taken that day.</p>

<p>XY: I feel like, uh, the little pink block with your name in it is a symbol of your, uh, heart beating.</p>

<p>XX: That’s because it is. We got to know each other as pixels, after all. Although my heart is probably beating much faster than the little pink block. Because of the adderall.</p>

<p>XY: I think this is how rich people feel by default and that’s why they get rich. I’m really glad I’m not like this by default, but instead only get like this when I’m poor and so become rich only in feelings and ideas and non-monetized digital productivity.</p>

<p>XX: I feel like Jesus said something along those lines. Right? That our richness is not measured by how much money we have, etc etc. Jesus was so radical. Maybe this is why heart attacks are so prevalent amongst businesspeople. Their hearts are beating this fast all the fucking time!</p>

<p>XY: Yea and amphetamines make people talk past each other full speed ahead—which we are even kind of doing right now, but which is totally OK because I know you genuinely care about my thoughts and feelings, you’re just overflowing with your own and I want you to do that. And I want to do that too, although I just wanted to register that a certain frantic, selfish insensitivity to the ideas or thoughts of others is possessing me right now. Like we are two really really fast speedboats zooming around a lake right now, which is OK and really fun but you also still make me so tender and I just want to register that. Uh, ok, I’m just going to keep going.</p>

<p>We had a couchsurfer from France once, he was an art history PhD student, actually, I’m glad you weren’t here because he was very handsome and I would have felt scared because I’m still a little boy probably—but he told me something that I really appreciated, and that I think in my life plan I am going to really, really sort of double-down on. His dissertation focused on American Pop Art and he said the truth is that Andy Warhol only gets so much credit for the very simple and mundane fact that he archived things better than anyone else at the time. That it’s really only about keeping good records, leaving behind a lot. Kind of like what I talk about when I talk about intensity as the only thing that matters, if you just do every single thing and record it then you’re a world historical genius. So easy. Feel like we should only ever write to each other on one Google Word Doc for the rest of our lives. We could maybe, truly, literally, write the most epic, uh, I wanna say “love letter” but you know, not trying to pack too much into that lol, just like, as a genre or something.</p>

<p>XX: Listen —</p>

<p>XX: Free bird —</p>

<p>XX: You are a fucking free fucking bird and so am I and we should like, fly around together but totally stick to own trajectories. And when we intersect, on occasion, it’ll be a cool thing and we can catch each other up on our flights.</p>

<p>XX: I like the idea of legacy but I find it unsatisfactory. Perhaps patriarchal. Because my legacy will be and already is intricately connected to the people around me, shit is relational, it is constituted by others, which is why I like what we are doing, simultaneously, constituting this relationship &amp; each other’s legacies in the process. I am going to go smoke a cigarette and maybe inhale deeply and slowly, but I am glad that you are out there somewhere &ndash; &ndash; not just somewhere, but somewhere that I have been, which is fucking cool, that we have occupied the same spaces for once in our fucking lives &ndash; &ndash;</p>

<p>XX: fly free, bird.</p>

<p>XY: Maybe good point about the desire for legacy being patriarchal. Yea, I think that’s right. It’s narcissistic and really a desire to dominate. I’d say I only want to dominate the dominators, but I don’t know if that’s OK. In the opposite direction, after our conversation last night I feel very comfortable right now sharing the silliest little micro-insecurities, because I’m prepared to release all fear of being a pathetic mess of ugly nerve endings. So I just want to tell you that in your last paragraph the last two lines made me feel really sad, actually, not for too long or anything but they really kinda made me happiness and ecstatic energy sink low very suddenly because you used the past tense and the word “once.” Those last two lines make me scared you are going to leave me.</p>

<p>XY: Also feel like I want to intersect more than “on occasion,” maybe felt tiny sad when you wrote “occasion.” Feel like I intersect with my family “on occasion” and I don’t really ever want to hang out with them that much. These few things make me scared you are going to leave me, they really feel shitty and scary. Trying not to act tough.</p>

<p>XX: Don’t act tough, toughness is stupid. It’s so obvious. I’m scared you’re going to leave too &ndash; when I went outside to smoke I thought about how great all of this is but how absolutely terrifying. I keep telling people that I came here to fail, which I find kind of funny, but of course affirming the possibility of failure is very different than affirming the failure itself. But, for what it is worth, my heart is ‘soaring’ (more bird/flight imagery) when I think about what has happened &amp; will continue. I do find it interesting that I am choosing to use flight imagery, but less maybe to point out the leaving and maybe moreso to point to the ‘touching down.’ The taking a breath, which is a really important part of flying but isn’t really talked about, taking a rest and then, maybe most beautifully, the deep breath before the next take-off. With you I am taking breaths! It’s such a cool thing to share with someone. In any case, I feel super positive about you —- wow positive is such a silly word but I won’t delete it — and I am really excited/terrified.</p>

<p>XX: Also, you know, I feel insecure all of the time. And not in the sense that all the time I am in a state of insecurity, which is obviously not true, but that, you know, I carry them with me. They are like kids screaming on the back of a school bus, and I’m like the driver, and getting them to shut up is a lot harder than just arriving at a stop and making them get off.</p>

<p>XX: “Get off my bus, you punks.”</p>

<p>XX: &lt;3</p>

<p>XX: lol</p>

<p>XY: Aria can you just not use the past tense talking about me or us? Like, unless it’s past.</p>

<p>XX: okay. I won’t.</p>

<p>XX: I won’t. I am wont to want you.</p>

<p>XY: What scares me is that this sort of high speed stream of consciousness dialogue maybe reveals things we might not reveal consciously—so it’s sad you used the past tense. And diminutives such as “on occasion.” It’s ok, of course! It’s just that I feel more like I’m soaring and want to keep soaring and not really breathe or stop or intersect with you but just like we’re both soaring, so simple to me, so obvious and amazing heh.</p>

<p>XX: “WHAT HAS HAPPENED &amp; WILL CONTINUE.”</p>

<p>XX: You know, lovebirds got their name because they actually cannot psychologically exist without another around. A friend of mine had a single lovebird and one day it started puking up its food — in any case it created a little puke-statue dovebird that it hung out with. I don’t know why I bring this up except maybe to say that if you weren’t around I might make a puke statue to you. This is my way of showing affection, heh.</p>

<p>XY: I’m not worried about becoming attached like lovebirds, because I have been feeling exactly as happy when you are in my physical presence as when you’re not—and we’re both rad independent ambitious folks so i’m just not worried on that front. because i’m not worried on that front, i want to only use the fucking realest most courageous and scary but beautiful language toward you and with you and about you. i want to not be afraid to feel and say crazy shit that’s only real and big and awesome. and if it’s not intense then i don’t want to say feel or do it, or something. feel like that is how we are powerful, or how we can become the kind of powerful we have alluded to before, like i think that’s the only way we can take over the world—didn’t that come up, taking over the world or something?</p>

<p>XX: OK, another random micro-insecurity: things will not always be so intense, arent’ there lulls and landings and breaths in every relationship? What if it is not so intense anymore? Or for a while? Taking over the world did come up. I feel like I can do that w you.</p>

<p>XY: Exactament! Uh, I think you’re totally right of course that lulls and landings come up, for sure! But they’ll come whether we want them or not—so I guess I’d rather just formally declare war on them, anyway. Might as well. Like I don’t want to produce more of them then are necessary just because we know they’re inescapable—with you Aria I want to destroy all lulls, landings, bores, bourgeois, breaths, parties, hangouts, cheap talk, small talk, fluff flarther furthings and even fun—to hell with it all, I just want to be, like, real, and intense and insane and beautiful and truthful, and if you want to with me then I will try to do that so hard, yea.</p>

<p>XX: Destroy all parties. The only way we’ll get there I think is by being honest. After our conversation last night I similarly feel ready to really open up to you. I really want to do that with you, I want it so badly and I am prepared to put every bit of myself towards it. Like, really, I am, yes I say yes I will yes.</p>

<p>XX: Let’s burn the fucking bed.</p>

<p>XY: (Lights match.)</p>

<p>XX: (Pours….kerosene? Gas? Olive oil!)</p>

<p>XY: Fin?</p>

<p>XY: Go do something beautiful, yea? We can talk plenty later!</p>

<p>XX: Okay. you do the same. Meet u in the sky.</p>

<p>FIN.</p>
