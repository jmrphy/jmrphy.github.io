		<p>Because there are still many people who continue to doubt systematic racial and gender bias in law enforcement, I have been working on some new statistical tests of these claims. Earlier today I released <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/A_Statistical_Analysis_of_Racism_and_Sexism_in_Stand_Your_Ground_Cases_in_Florida_2006_2013/1301532">new statistical evidence of racism and sexism in the enforcement of &ldquo;stand your ground&rdquo; (SYG) laws</a>, using a sample of cases from Florida in the period from 2006 to 2013. A detailed explanation of the data, methods, and findings (including fully reproducible data and code) can be found in the full working paper linked above.</p>

<p>Below, I summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>The two key findings</li>
<li>What if Trayvon Martin had been white? What if Marissa Alexander had been male?</li>
<li>What is new about these findings and why they matter</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>The two key findings</h3>

<p>1) The probability of conviction for a white defendant against a white victim in a typical case is fairly high at around 90% but with a large margin of error, whereas <strong>the probability of conviction for a black defendant against a white victim approaches 100%, even after controlling for more than 10 different objective factors related to the circumstances of the incident.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Expected_Probability_of_Conviction_by_Race_of_Victim_and_Defendant_in_Stand_Your_Ground_Cases_Florida_2006_2013_/1301534"><img src="http://previews.figshare.com/1880691/860/p_01.png" height="400" width="500" alt="Expected Probability of Conviction by Race of Victim and Defendant in &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Cases (Florida, 2006-2013)" /></a></p>

<p>2) The probability of conviction for a male defendant in a typical domestic case is found to be about 40%, but <strong>for a female defendant in an otherwise objectively equivalent case the probability of conviction increases dramatically to 80%</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Expected_Probability_of_Conviction_by_Gender_of_Defendant_in_Domestic_and_Non_Domestic_Stand_Your_Ground_Cases_in_Florida/1301535"><img src="http://previews.figshare.com/1880692/860/p_01.png" height="400" width="500" alt="Expected Probability of Conviction by Gender of Defendant in Domestic and Non-Domestic &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Cases (Florida, 2006-2013)" /></a></p>

<h3>What these models teach us about recent cases</h3>

<p>1) The probability George Zimmerman was going to be found guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 was marginally greater than 50% but would have been about 98% if Trayvon Martin had been white.</p>

<p>2) Black female Marissa Alexander who fired a physically innocuous warning shot to deter her husband in 2010 faced a probability of conviction marginally greater than 50%, but the probability of conviction for a male defendant in an otherwise objectively equivalent situation would have been around only 12%.</p>

<h3>What is new about these findings and why they matter</h3>

<p>1) The only previous statistical analysis of racial bias in the enforcement of stand your grown laws at the level of individual cases concluded that there has been no racial bias. Conservative gun advocate John Lott analyzed the same data I analyzed and submitted his analysis as testimony to the US Senate Judiciary Committee. As I explain in the paper, his statistical modelswere very superficially reported and deeply flawed. Thus, <strong>my findings overturn the last most influential study which, I believe, incorrectly informed US policymakers.</strong></p>

<p>2) This analysis controls for a very large number of contextual factors which are frequently invoked to dismiss claims of racism and sexism. In other words, if anyone ever says the legal system is not racist or sexist but people of color and/or women are simply more likely to do/be some other thing which rightfully earns them convictions and just happens to be correlated with race or gender, <strong>my study provides evidence of racism and sexism in SYG enforcement even <em>after</em> subtracting out any effect which might come from race or gender correlating with a long list of common conservative excuses</strong>: whether the victim initiates, whether the defendant can retreat, whether the defendant pursues, whether the defendant has a gun, whether the incident takes place on the defendant’s property, whether the victim dies, age of victim and defendant, whether there is physical evidence, whether there is a witness, and whether the victim is committing a crime.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2014/12/17/a-few-saturdays-ago+copy/" itemprop="url">I wondered if I’m allowed to ask if I’m allowed</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Walking through the city centre a few Saturdays ago, I made eye contact with a thin young blonde girl wearing a huge camouflage army coat and when I did the vague acknowledgment smile thing she murmured something to me which of course I didn’t really hear. I took out my earphones or earbuds or whatever they’re called now, and asked what she said. She was promoting a party thing at a nightclub and, in a strong northern accent, asked if I liked house music. I said I don’t really know, that I’ve heard it before but I don’t really know if I like it. She asked what kind of music I like. I said I don’t know.</p>

<p>“I used to be hip but I’m not anymore,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, you look pretty hip,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh cool, thanks,” I said, looking down at myself thinking “hipster insurrectionary” and wondering if I would ever grow out of it but feeling like no probably not despite, or because, it is a bit absurd to dress in black bloc working at a computer all day.</p>

<p>She said it’s like techno but something something different about beats dropping more or less. I said oh, cool. I neglected to mention that in a previous life, in a faraway land, I was once engaged in a bitter social war against all DJs, against the monopoly they held and continue to hold on the libidinal resources of the youth. She gave me a card thing that would get me in for £5 instead of £7.50, and I said oh cool, thanks. I also said with uncertainty but perfect sincerity—which I was surprised to feel—that maybe I would go. She asked if I wanted a second one for a friend. I awkwardly said, uh no that’s OK, thanks.</p>

<p>“Well look, here’s a ticket so you can get in for free. I can get you free drinks, too,” she said.
I couldn’t tell how old she was, seemed probably between 16 and 27. I didn’t really care about her age so much as the main issue. I asked, “You’re not a student here, are you?” No, she was from Leeds, never went to university, just into house music and stuff. Oh OK cool, I said, that’s cool.
Nonetheless unsure exactly why she was being so nice, when she handed me the ticket I said, “Oh wow, cool.”</p>

<p>Before returning to her party-promoting group about ten feet away, she said to me in a tutorly voice, “Take my number and text me when you get there, and I’ll show you how it works,” as if I had never been to a nightclub ever. Then it dawned on me that she probably just felt bad for me and wanted to help me, this American guy in a minor British city who doesn’t know what kind of music he likes and apparently has nobody to bring along to a nightclub and does not in any part of his self-presentation really appear to be a member of any recognizable milieu but who, now amused and relaxed, says “OK yea, I think I’ll come.”</p>

<p>Walking away, I wondered to myself if I was going to do drugs that night, then I wondered if university lecturers are allowed to do drugs. Then I wondered if I’m allowed to ask if I’m allowed to do drugs, like if I asked someone higher up in the university if I’m allowed to drugs and the answer was no then I would be judged and punished just as much as if they found me on Instagram snorting a line of coke hashtag #idodrugs. I imagined someone later in the night handing me drugs, and me asking them to confirm they are not a student before I quickly strongly thought “this is not going to work.” But then I thought “Timothy Leary” and that made me calm enough to decide I would play it by ear.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h5>The Puzzle</h5>

<p>There is a widespread consensus in the economics literature that the rise of information technology over the past several decades has been a “skill-biased technological change.” A skill-biased technological change increases the productivity of skilled workers more than it improves the productivity of unskilled workers, therefore increasing the demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers. This increased demand for skilled workers, ceteris paribus, <a href="http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000493">increases their income relative to unskilled workers</a>. It is widely agreed that this is a key explanation for at least some of the rapid increase in income inequality since the 1980s.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> One key observation consistent with this theory is that it is only after the appearance of micro-computers that income inequality begins to rise in the early 1980s.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> A second key observation is that more educated workers are more likely to use a computer on the job<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Despite this growing interest in the economic implications of technological change, social scientists have failed to take seriously a surprisingly similar line of thought advanced most notably in twentieth-century German philosophy. Heidegger and, later, the Frankfurt School theorists developed critical theories of technology which argued, in different ways, that technological changes shape ethical attitudes toward the world. In particular, a specific line of thought revolves around the relationship between technological development and instrumental rationality, or in other words formal analytical rationality which renounces consideration of substantive goals and concerns itself only with calculating the optimal means toward given ends.</p>

<p>For Heidegger, from a phenomenological perspective, technology represents a &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; of Being which generates a relation to the world in which nature and other humans are merely &ldquo;standing-reserve&rdquo; waiting to be exploited as means to whatever ends. For Adorno, Horkheimer, and especially Marcuse, modern technological advancements were &ldquo;organizing and perpetuating (or changing) social relationships, a manifestation of prevalent thought and behavior patterns, an instrument for control and domination.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>While positivist social scientists have long perceived these types of claims from continential social theory to be hopelessly speculative and empirically intractable, this is puzzling given that the core claim emerging from this particular current in the critical theory of technology is relatively straightforward: technological development increases the prevalence of instrumentalism among other possible ethical attitudes toward the world. Moreover, the theory of skill-biased technological change is a powerful heuristic for modeling this argument given that it is a well-established model of how technology can generate unequal distributions of power without any reference to Marxian bugaboos which have likely caused more confusion than clarity by now.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>However, it is perhaps more fair to observe that critical theorists indeed sometimes lack what contemporary social scientists would call “mechanisms,&ldquo; or specifiable and testable triggers which effectively do the work of some variable <em>X</em> supposedly causing some variable <em>Y</em>. While this particular critique of technological development is not delivered with any particular &#8220;mechanism&rdquo; which would be intelligible to many empirical social scientists working today, critical theory does supply many useful hints in this direction. Moreover, the basic argument is surprisingly consistent with well-known economic models, however disparate might be the vocabularies, thus permitting the elaboration of a critical theory of technological change empirically testable and consistent with a rational-choice framework.</p>

<h5>A Theory</h5>

<p>To better specify the mechanism whereby technological change may plausibly generate a greater prevalence of instrumental ethics, I propose a theory of <em>ethically-biased</em> technological change. I argue that certain technological changes can increase the income paid to certain ethical orientations relative to others. As in the theory of skill-biased technological change, certain technological changes increase the productivity of certain ethical orientations relative to others, increasing their relative demand, and therefore increasing their relative income. This increase in relative income represents a premium paid to those with the ethical resources required by the new technology, just as skill-biased technological change generates a premium paid to those with the technical resources required by the new technology.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>More specifically, a technological change which increases productivity but transgresses <em>any particular ethical value</em> will increase the productivity of individuals with the weakest commitment to that ethical value relative to those more firmly committed to that ethical value, thus increasing demand for them relative to the more ethical individuals, and thereby increasing their relative income. Ethically transgressive technological innovations increase the productivity of the least ethical because ethical compunctions are effectively a psychological tax on a worker. It is hard to take a job, and then demoralizing to work it, to the degree one feels ethical compunction for doing so. While an employer would have to pay very high wages to attract highly ethical workers to an ethically transgressive job, the wages they have to pay to attract relatively unethical workers will tend to be lower. The firmer one&rsquo;s ethical commitment, the greater is the tax one pays to work an ethically transgressive job, the less worthwhile the wage, and the less likely is one to take the job; the weaker one&rsquo;s ethical commitment, the lower is the tax, the more worthwhile is the wage, and the more likely one is to take the job. The overall implication is that technological change rewards individuals with weak ethical convictions relative to individuals with strong ethical convictions, and therefore exerts a direct, material pressure on the evolution of ethics within society.</p>

<p>There are three key, testable implications we would expect to observe if this model indeed captures important aspects of the historical record. First, during times of ethically transgressive technological innovation, the first workers will be individuals who before the technological innovation were already less ethically scrupulous on the relevant ethical dimension. Second, workers of the new technology will be paid a premium which would be, in principle, distinct from any skill premium, although of course these can be correlated. Third, if we add the assumption of modern capitalist institutions, wherein wage workers have no common land and no immediate means of production, then the price of integrity for committedly ethical individuals literally becomes death. This last implication means that, if technological change is ethically biased as I hypothesize, the steady-state to which it must tend in the long-run is the absolute evacuation of integrity from all participants in the labor market. Note that this can come about through two different causal pathways: ethical individuals can learn to sacrifice their integrity to compete with the unethical and survive, <em>and/or</em> ethical individuals can literally die off while unethical individuals thrive and replace them (evolutionary change). It should be noted explicitly that while observations 1 and 2 show how ethically-biased technological change reward certain ethical orientations differently and unequally,</p>

<p>Anecdotally, a general acquaintenace with the contours of modern history seems to suggest some striking evidence for this model of ethically-biased technology change. Consider, for instance, that while a certain amount of philosophical liberalism was no doubt necessary for the industrial revolution to emerge, and this perhaps explains why it began in England, it seems equally undeniable that the industrial revolution in turn <em>generated</em> an extraordinary instrumental turn and valorization of self-interest wherever it went. It will obviously require more work to test this expectation more rigorously, but it seems highly probable.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>In summary, building from insights of the Frankfurt School, I provide a specific, empirically testable mechanism which accounts for the large-scale historical variations in ethical outlook they described to the dismissal of the mainstream social scientists of the time. Working heuristically from rational-choice economic theory, my stylized theoretical model is consistent with but more general than the rational-choice framework because the model here in some sense explains what rational-choice models merely assume (the prevalance of instrumentally rational dispositions).</p>

<p>If correct, the long-run, world-historical implication of this model could not be more staggering for understanding the ethical experience of living through modern, let alone contemporary, capitalism: if this model is correct, then it would mean that today we have inherited a world in which ethical integrity has been subjected to a roughly 300-500 year forced evacuation by labor market institutions.</p>

<p>Indeed, the analogy between skill-biased and ethically-biased technological change is all the more apt if we, with Foucault, conceptualize the practice of ethos as itself a kind of technical game; if ethical resources are themselves understood as technologies of the self. Key examples in this context are those most bourgeois of ethical resources: the various techniques of repressing ethical compunctions and moral anxieties, and the various techniques of guilt management consequently required by this ethos. In this register, ethically-biased technological change would be essentially identical to skill-biased technological with the exception that the &ldquo;skills&rdquo; in question are the skills of self-management rather than economic production. The reason we must avoid this reductionism at the outset is that it would beg the most important question, namely, the question regarding <em>how</em> exactly did the contemporary human become, quite peculiar in the long-run of world history, so instrumentalist that the only activities remaining in contemporary life are exploiting and suffering exploitation?<a href="#fnref:6" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>From the 1920s until the end of World War II, the conventional wisdom was that the role of mass
media in modern society was, and ought to be, an instrument of propaganda for the optimal
functioning of the state (@Bernays:2004vo; @lippmann1932public). With the rise of information theory, which would become a basis for modern computing (@Shannon:2013iy; @gleick2011information), in the post-war period there was a flowering of social-scientific efforts to link the propaganda role of media to the burgeoning framework of information theory [@wiener1965cybernetics; @Deutsch:1953ww; @Deutsch:1966ux; @McLuhan:1994tf; @Ellul:1965uf].<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Norbert Wiener was arguably chief among the towering intellectual figures of the midcentury attempting to understand society with the new tools of information theory. Wiener named the new science &ldquo;cybernetics,&rdquo; a term which gained some limited currency at the time but has since fallen into oblivion. Cybernetics was, essentially, an information theory of society: institutions, organizations, and even social systems more generally are machines comparable to mechanic devices. What they all have in common is that their existence is sustained by mechanisms which effectively send signals and respond to signals. The mechanism in an automobile engine which prevents it from overheating is a mechanism which responds to the signal of too much heat, just as the mechanism of elections is supposed to prevent politicians from pursuing unpopular policies. Information theory would allow us to understand political power and social control as essentially, in their most basic units, dynamics of communication.</p>

<p>For Wiener, then, communication and control were the same thing, and he argued passionately that humanity was on the brink of a new age where communication and control would define society: &ldquo;The thought of every age is reflected in its technique&hellip; If the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries are the age of clocks, and the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries constitute the age of steam engines, the present time is the age of communication and control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Wiener also wrote passionately and ominously that the American state and small elite groups posed an extraordinary threat in this new age of communication and control. Starting in World War II and continuing throughout the Cold War, the US state was aggressively bringing science under its aegis. This is well-known and well-documented, but it is especially interesting that it is also reflected in the lives and thought of many of the very towering intellectual figures who were at the forefront of the new sciences. Wiener, for instance, believed firmly in the independent scientist and avoided institutional affiliations, although he did choose to help the war effort in anti-aircraft research. &ldquo;Without any doubt,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;we possess the world&rsquo;s most highly developed technique of combining the efforts of large numbers of scientists and large quantities of money toward the realization of a single project.&rdquo; [@Wiener:1989ud, 126].<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Today, the incipient social-scientific theories of thinkers such as Wiener and McLuhan appear remarkably cynical: given the longstanding conventional wisdom of elites that the media were mere tools of propaganda, the
emergence of legitimately scientific models of information quite naturally led social theorists to
conceptualize the media as instruments of social control. Thus, these early efforts are laden with
surprisingly sinister vocabularies, the most recurring themes revolving around the control,
monitoring, and shaping of mass publics.</p>

<p>These early social scientists of the media, most of whom were writing within democratic states, had
surprisingly little to say about the media having anything to do with the empowerment of the masses. This is puzzling given that, today, scholars and schoolchildren alike are most immediately inclined
to think of the media as a watchdog over government, the main purpose of which is to ensure popular
sovereignty through the free flow of information. Today, even those social scientists most critical
of media effects are exceptions which prove the rule, as they typically frame their findings as
raising questions about the medias well-known function as government watchdog.</p>

<p>If the earliest and most influential social-scientific models of the media were so cynical, then
why, when and, how did contemporary social scientists develop such a sanguine view of the media? I
do not pretend to offer any definitive answer to such questions, but we ought to float some short
and provisional answers to these questions.</p>

<p>Wiener understood the system-level of ideas and communication politics, but he was surprisingly naive to think his ethical arguments could win the day. According to his very outlook, such ideas were like &ldquo;negative feedback&rdquo; mechanisms which were purely imaginery: the nervous system he described had to discard that ethical information like our bodies discard germs. For, his ethical critique called into question the very nature of state-and-market-centered political system in the information age.</p>

<p>The extraordinary negative pressures faced by people such as Wiener and Oppenheimer and Einstein when they chose to speak out, is perhaps evidence of the political system&rsquo;s nervous system neutralizing threats. Oppenheimer&rsquo;s villainization by the state as a &ldquo;security threat&rdquo; and the humiliating trial in front of the House Un-American committee was itself an act of power and control through communication&mdash;the public was being told these people and their ethical ideas were bad, i.e. their behavior was being shaped away from such ethical principles. Wiener&rsquo;s publishers (embodying market forces), put pressure on him to tone down the political sharpness of his perspective,observable in the difference between the first and second editions of <em>The Human Use of Human Beings</em>.</p>

<p>But where did our benign democratic notions of the media come from, when for several decades the
conventional wisdom on the role of media was expressly anti-democratic and the very nature of
information was now becoming understood scientifically? This intersection in intellectual history
would seem to predict a future in which the various media would become all the more powerful tools
for small national elites to control and manipulate mass publics, the vision largely shared by so
many incipient post-war social scientists. But yet, the notion of propaganda recedes from the social
sciences from its high point around 1950, while the study of information continues increasing and
the social scientific study of media begins in earnest.</p>

<p>In some sense, these social-scientific currents which are only just beginning to theorize the mass
media with an emphasis on propaganda and information control are absorbed by government and the
private sector. It appears as if this incipient social-scientific perspective is adopted and <em>put
into practice</em> by various branches of the state, as in the rise of “counterinsurgency” abroad (Carruthers) and
government “public relations” at home, or otherwise the private commercial development of
communications engineering and “operations management.” As the new sciences of information control
are put into practice by the state and the private sector, it is at this time that the curiously
mild-mannered attitude toward the media is elevated into a baseline for political science research
(Lazarsfeld 1944; Berelson 1954; Campbell et al. 1960).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> This baseline conventional
wisdom of “limited effects” from media would no doubt be challenged within political science, but it
nonetheless has remained dominant (Katz; Bartels 2008). That research funding distributed by the
U.S. government and the private sector played a prominent role in the mainstreaming and
institutionalization of the Columbia and Michigan models of political science research approaches,
at the very same time that information theory is being rapidly mobilized in actual state and
corporate operations and logistics, further tempts one to the hypothesis that perhaps the greatest
achievement of state and corporate media control was to have ensured that social scientists would
never quite succeed in understanding or demonstrating the media’s function in social control.</p>

<p>This is why the present detour through intellectual history is not merely a review of the literature; rather, this sociological review of the literature is itself suggestive
empirical evidence, however circumstantial, regarding a crucial transformation in our thinking and
practices of media politics. I have traced in the record of the social sciences the transformation
of media-as-propaganda to media-as-transparency to outline a general gap in the literature which
this volume contributes to filling, but also to present some provisional evidence, very close to
home, of precisely how media-as-propaganda may shape certain institutional political outcomes in
ways which have hardly been noticed. Indeed, if the media are most importantly propaganda tools
then, to the very degree they are politically effective, we would expect them to go unnoticed by
institutional social science. Indeed, even the exceptions suggest evidence for this rule, for the
most popular intellectual inheritors of the media-as-propaganda tradition today remain marginal to
dominant mainstream social science.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Oppenheimer, a crucial figure in the American development of an atomic bomb, would later speak out against the hydrogen bomb and was aggressively maligned as a &ldquo;security threat&rdquo; by the US government and in the mass media. Einstein, as well, was mocked for his critical attitude toward developments in the state&rsquo;s relationship to science. All of this is to point out that the most towering intellectual figures of this time were beginning to converge on the belief that the institutional dynamics of science were unconscionable.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>The Columbia group around Lazarsfeld, from the beginning, was really only interested in what was already a highly narrow and market-oriented type of behavioral variation. Bartels notes how they only turned to electoral behavior when they could not find grantvmoney to study consumer behavior (Rossi 1959, 15-16, as cited in     Bartels 2008). The point for our purposes is that these pioneering studies which would become baselines for the modern study of political behavior rose to prominence with a view of the media that already abstracted away from the more “sinister” media effects predicted by the group discussed above. Thus, by the 1954 <em>Voting: A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign, </em>the Columbia group finds little evidence for the role of parties and media in presidential campaigns. The later Michigan group, whose election studies would become an increasingly institutionalized backbone of American political science research, also had a view of the media which is puzzlingly inane and conservative read alongside work of roughly the same period by someone such as Karl Deutsch. Of course, I do not here take issue with the validity of these early findings as far as they go; my point is only to flag that these foundational studies in American political science adopted an approach which  generated strikingly inane findings on the political effects of media, especially when read alongside those who were grappling with the more general historical functions of media as institutions of social control.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Early theorists in modern political science had high hopes for using new survey techniques to analyze the individual-level psychological and behavorial processes which constitute modern liberal democracy. Berelson (1952), for instance, noted that democratic theory assumes that citizens meet certain requirements related to tolerance, patience, interest, knowledge, and the will to participate.</p>

<p>But early research in political behavior was extremely bleak: most people had little knowledge of politics, most political opinions were not based on facts, most people were generally authoritarian and prejudiced, they typically only listened to views they already agreed with, and participation in politics was low (Prothro and Grigg 1960; McCloskey 1964; Cobb and Elder 1971, 893). In short, much of this first wave of political science research, largely based on the new survey methods growing popular at the time, would have seemed damning evidence that the citizens of the United States&#8217; simply do not constitute what is called democracy.</p>

<p>Rather than take these studies as ammunition to protest the US political system&mdash;and perhaps joining the students, the blacks, and the women who at this very time <em>were</em> doing precisely this&mdash;the next wave of political scientists simply argued that early theorists of democracy had too narrow a definition of democracy. The new idea was that &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; only requires an empirical relationship between public opinion and policymaking <em>in the aggregate</em>. If the actual direction of state policymaking were to show zero correlation with shifts in public opinion, this would be damning evidence that what the public wants has no affect on the policies pursued by state elites. But so long as policymaking in general moves in response to aggregate public opinion, this is adequate evidence that the &ldquo;macropolity&rdquo; is indeed a functioning democracy. And indeed, since then, political scientists have found that in democracies, shifts in public opinion tend to be followed by corresponding shifts in policymaking. Many scholars interpert these findings as evidence that democratic institutions deliver what they&rsquo;re supposed to: mass public control over the general direction of national policymaking.</p>

<p>As scholars pointed out even at the time, it is a very conservative move to solve the problem of undemocratic realities by simply weakening the definition of democracy (Easton 1969; Walker 1966; Bachrach 1967). I&rsquo;m interested in specifying and, in the future, measuring and testing two specific aspects of this politically and therefore scientifically problematic move.</p>

<p>1.) I hypothesize that a crucial unjustified problem at this moment in political science, a theoretical and empirical problem never yet adequately addressed and which bears extraordinary significance for true popular social change, is that <em>what people express as their opinion is significantly determined by what the status quo institutions at that moment will permit.</em> This is because in general, people do not express political demands for policy changes which they believe are impossible given the institutional landscape. Such an articulation is seen as stupid, naive, or simply meaningless, so individuals calculate and articulate their political desires in a way that effectively assumes the institutional status quo <em>as given</em>. In this way, discourse on the level of &ldquo;public opinion&rdquo; (e.g., asking people questions about what a current government should do) contains an &ldquo;approval&rdquo; of the status quo which is not real but is simply assumed into their answer by the nature of the question. Political science since this period essentially imputes to citizens a baseline level of &ldquo;support&rdquo; for a status quo which is really nothing more than their degree of capitulation to a status quo which (variably and contingently) presents itself as given and unmovable. These two components&mdash;sincere approval of the status quo and mere compliance with power (the very nature of which is to be taken as given)&mdash;have never been adequately disaggregated. Public opinion has only ever been, from its beginning, a measured aggregate response to questions which are generated in part by an unmeasured quantum of political force.</p>

<p>In this light, we might begin to hypothesize that political practices such as delegation, the proliferation of subnational and/or supranational bureacracies charged with certain policymaking imperatives and/or prohibitions, have more to do with public opinion than is typically thought. For instance, the European Commission was designed to be the &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of European integration precisely because it would be insulated from the snags of domestic resistances. We might hypothesize that the establishment of a bureaucratically insulated policymaking institution such as the EC (or any other sub- or supra-national institution which removes a portion of policymaking power from democratic control) lowers the salience of certain public opinion questions and/or decreases the tendency of citizens to articulate certain approvals or disapprovals. Political scientists such as Timothy Hellwig have shown that citizens do indeed discount their judgments of the political landscape based on exogenous changes such as economic globalization, but this logic ought to apply to any institutional change with any effect on what it is possible for certain actors to do or not do. Specifically, purposeful institutional innovations might have the effect of ameliorating citizens negative judgments of certain actors or other previously existing institutions, or perhaps they might diffuse blame across so many institutions that citizens no longer feel dissatisfied with any of them. More specifically in our example, the advent of the EC might weaken citizens&#8217; negative judgments of domestic policymakers, if they believe domestic policymakers have a weaker institutional role in setting policy than before the advent of the EC.</p>

<p>Researchers will have to disaggregate these &ldquo;authentic-individual&rdquo; and &ldquo;forced-institutional&rdquo; components of public opinion data before we can take them seriously as reflections of genuine support or disapproval of the political status quo.</p>

<p>2.) Another extraordinary threat to this already conservative rationalization of contemporary public policymaking is the possibility that public opinion is itself determined by political and economic elites. For, of course, if changes in public opinion were found to be determined by status quo political factors not democratically determined (distinct from and in addition to the baseline bias caused by institutions, outlined above), then even robust correlations between aggregate public opinion and policymaking could no longer be taken seriously as evidence of democracy.</p>

<p>This is the claim of critics such as David Harvey. They point to the 1970s as a crucial period. The example of Lewis Powell&rsquo;s memo to the US Chamber of Commerce (Harvey 2005, 43). The Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers began a significant and documented intensification of its spending, lobbying, and membership. The Business Roundtable is founded in 1972. Corporate interests start funding a large group of think-tanks and academic institutions as well. NBER is an example. The Trilateral commission in 1973, the report by political scientists called &ldquo;The Crisis of Democracy.&rdquo; Nozick, Milton Freedom on TV. Of course, this remains to be demonstrated very convincingly in the quantitative literature, but I should like to try.</p>

<p>But even the mainstream &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; literature testifies to the fact that &ldquo;political marketing&rdquo; has as much to do with selling political products, i.e. producing political ideas, as gauging what citizens demand (Lees-Marshment 2011, 9). They quite openly and uncontroversially use techniques of manipulation, taken from advertising and marketing. So it is hardly a fringe left-wing idea that public opinion is the object as much as it is the subject of policymakers.</p>
