		<h4>Reflections on social science, honesty, insurrection, communism, carts, and horses.</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>I took a bus from Southampton to attend the Radical Left General Assembly in London last Thursday night. I took the trip for two special reasons. The Tory victory completely flummoxed political scientists, so as a political scientist I was especially curious to see how London radicals would start filling this cognitive vacuum left open by the systematic errors of the official intelligentsia. But as someone who came into ultraleft politics through Occupy Wall Street, I have to admit the second reason I went to London that evening: I once again fell for that last temptation of the sad insurrectionary, the hope that someone else might kick off somewhere else. A few people asked me to report back and some others asked me what I thought about it. Here is my report back. There were a lot of people there. Different people said most of the usual things. It was kind of interesting at times and not at others. Most of the time all I could really think about was the image of a cart in front of a horse. Here are my personal thoughts on it. I want everyone there to succeed in everything they want to do and I’m going to do everything I can to help, no less and certainly no more.</p></li>
<li><p>As the internet fills with what everyone thinks everyone else should do now that the Tories are in power, here is what I’m <em>not</em> going to do. I’m not going to criticise the Assembly or any of the ideas expressed there. I’m not bothered. I’m glad to see anyone saying and doing anything they want, whether I think it’s ridiculous or not.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’m certainly not going to propose my brilliant vision for what everyone else should do. If there is anything I would criticise, it’s the way that our deep-seated, individual wills to power require us to express judgment of others and seek recognition from them at the same time. But I’m not going to criticise that because the only motivation for doing so is to feel smart and powerful. I don’t want to feel smart or powerful, I want collective liberation immediately. We have lots of people who are smart and who present themselves powerfully, but we do not have enough collective liberation. While correlation does not necessarily imply causation, my own wager is that there is a causal relation here.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people in the pacified capitalist democracies do not live human lives and few of us still aspire to; I don’t blame anyone, for we have been robbed and we may any day take back what belongs to us, I just think it necessary to take an honest measure of things. I’m not romantically speculating on a mythical age, it is an empirical fact that while humans persist life itself has long been going extinct. While this deserves more empirical attention than is possible here, everything seems to indicate that all of our very capacities for participating in meaningful relationships and taking risks for principled ethical convictions—essential features of any truly human life and certainly basic requirements for any liberal pluralist fantasy of organising out of contemporary domination—were unfathomably stronger across many countries even forty years ago.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> One can debate the details but to speak about movement-building while not seriously reckoning with fundamental changes in the most basic capacities of human beings cannot help but reek of bad faith.</p></li>
<li><p>People have meetings and assemblies to talk about how to stop a government. I was barely convinced that it was worth getting out of bed today and I hardly live up to my part in one or two good human relationships but OK, I’ll vote on a resolution to stop the Tory government, because that <em>sounds like</em> something a living human being would try to do. The only problem is that I’m not a living human being. For most people activism means play-acting the role of a good, living human being as a solution to the vexing and intolerably challenging <em>fact</em> that one is actually neither very good nor very living. I work 40-60 hours some weeks and 95% of everything I say on a daily basis is neither lying nor truth-telling but simple functioning for a status quo order which I absolutely know to be wrong. I can’t even smell the roses when I literally walk by roses on my way to work, and someone wants me to vote on what we should name our political movement against the government? I don’t want to do that anymore. I think that honesty is <a href="http://jmrphy.net/blog/2015/04/14/on-being-honestly-bad/">a kind of North star for finding roads to liberation</a>, for it is the only thing that can guide diverse people from diverse starting points to a destination that all parties can trust. I will come to the general assemblies and I will come to the demos and I will stand by eviction defenses and I will continue to write, but I won’t pretend to be alive by pretending to start a movement when I know perfectly well that my main problem, and probably ours, is precisely having lost the capacity to move and be moved.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a chasm between what it is reasonable to talk about in <em>serious</em> organising meetings—namely, goals, strategies, tactics, and movements—and what is often dismissed as merely antics, such as the art of well-timed defiant laughter, graffiti, random or systematic acts of queering, unspoken work slowdowns, <a href="http://jmrphy.net/blog/2012/10/20/revolutionary-fun/">fun</a>, the aesthetics of walking in mobs, pilfering and shoplifting, etc. These latter don’t qualify as the stuff of “serious organising,” and indeed they are not. What they are, however, are indications or measures of true human life bubbling up through the surface of institutions fortified primarily by instrumental seriousness; these are, in short, the only things in the world that could ever be worth organising, after the fact of their emergence. In other words, organising a “movement” presupposes some excess of human energy <em>already</em> circulating and beginning to escape the institutional order: it presupposes horses to which organisers believe we would do well to attach some carts. But today, those who speak of carts know nothing of horses; while this could certainly be forgiven, it is much harder to understand those cart mechanics who believe themselves independent of the equestrian. On the other hand, those who still ride horses have learned too well to steer clear of these odd mechanics.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p>All collectives which are able solve this puzzle, those which are able to become and attract healthy horses <em>and</em> build carts which fit well enough <em>behind  them</em> that the horses don’t prefer to flee the stables at night or otherwise die from exhaustion, will be the multiple centers of the present insurrection. For such beings it is always a present insurrection. But what does this imply for those, like me most of the time, and perhaps most people in the pacified Western countries, who are merely isolated, alienated, individual creatures? It follows that one crucial task is to intensify as much as possible the process of more openly and publicly becoming who one is with anyone else mutually attracted—and <em>everyone</em> can be certain of finding mutual attraction somewhere because in some sense this is the core operation of beauty itself, like the flower in bloom. Concretely, this refers to a process which can be summarised as follows.</p></li>
<li><p>First, I incrementally remove from my perception of the future those hesitations of calculation and calculated hesitations which together constitute my paralysing anxiety, but which are rooted only in the protection and extension of ultimately false, private investments in the status quo (material and symbolic). Each instance of doing this is well known to free up disalienating and inherently liberatory energies, and each ounce of this energy, being precisely the only fuel that could ever make any honest project run truly, is then invested in those with whom I believe I have the best chance of kicking something off. If they receive it and invest themselves in the same fashion, then this unit has achieved the most basic operation of what is called communism. From even the most minor of such communalisations, be they symbolic or material, limitlessly large groups of militant resistance can then be spun further. Building a movement for true social justice as soon as possible may only mean increasing the density of this web by any means necessary until everyone has freely and sincerely chosen it. Beyond a certain threshold (which some network-analytic research suggests may be much lower than one would think, possibly as low as 10% of people fully defected from the institutions and fully invested in the commons), the generalised ethical insurrection that is real communism becomes <em>a fait accompli</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to gain and help spread the will to live at any cost. I don’t want to fight on a plane that’s already been vanquished. To end the new government and all other unjust institutions which dominate our lives, it is enough to become ungovernable. Such a process is as amenable to serious empirical investigation, experimentation, and, ultimately, “organisation,” as any other. But to put this horse in front of our carts in many ways requires us to let go or at least, with extreme irreverence, re-invent quite a many activist truisms, “social movement” wisdoms, and inherited routines. For instance, I doubt that the name of a “movement” is something we should ever be so bored to be concerned with, a name is something status quo investors will impose on us when our will to live has revived enough that we can be said to collectively exist. But this time around it will hardly matter because we will know better than to listen to anything other than what our comrades are saying right in front of us.</p>

<p> In this light, “organising” suddenly means something very different. It becomes a matter of gaining theoretical mastery over the empirical mechanisms of radicalisation to know and practice the concrete operations which actually increase the amount of insurrectionary energy and decrease the amount of status quo inertia in the world, developing styles of life consistent with these operations but obedient to nothing, such that we become not only able to demonstrate the real and reliable empirical mechanisms which underwrite our own trajectories of liberation and therefore make us a reasonable bet for others to risk themselves on (an instrumental aspect), but also become actual life forces which draw sincere attraction by virtue of our actual truth and beauty rather than sadly begging for it as human beings we are precisely not yet becoming.</p></li>

<p>I quite liked one pamphlet I was handed, though it&rsquo;s probably indicative of something that I already read and liked it <a href="http://davidcameronsspittle.tumblr.com/">on the internet</a> the day before, and the person who handed me a copy in London didn&rsquo;t have much time to chat despite my expression of interest. I don&rsquo;t blame them, I probably seemed like a cop or something, some random American dude who doesn&rsquo;t know anybody asking questions about some pamphlet. Still, taken as a whole, I could not help but read into the evening a number of possible blockages or mis-wirings in the circuits that run from different types of public communication to relationships to action and collective change.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Not to mention a slew of other maladies which have been on the rise, including depression, interpersonal mistrust, anomie, and <a href="http://www.weareplanc.org/blog/we-are-all-very-anxious/">the dominant affect of our moment: anxiety.</a><a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>It is in this space that I understand the idea of a <a href="http://www.weareplanc.org/">Plan C:</a> Trying to take seriously the reality of contemporary experiences such as pervasive anxiety through a radically creative politics of openness and the refusal of inherited but obviously failing, activist commonplaces. For instance, the vision of <a href="http://www.weareplanc.org/blog/on-social-strikes-and-directional-demands/">an updated social strike fit to the current moment.</a> Yet this is also a good example of how I am still interested in probing further what political scientists might call the &ldquo;microfoundations&rdquo; of such a macro-level vision. I fear that even such nuanced macro-level visions still beg the question of how to get the horse in front of the cart: how to catalyze enough currently non-existing human vitality in enough quarters such that there comes into existence the <em>energy required to withdraw one&rsquo;s energy,</em> let alone invest it in communism.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A diversity of inequalities will always make revolutionary politics difficult. Of course, many previous revolutionary projects tried to solve this problem by simply ignoring some types of inequality and prioritizing the equalization of certain, select inequalities. Clearly, in the most infamous revolutionary projects of the twentieth century, class or economic inequalities were typically prioritized over other types of inequality, such as those related to race and gender. This is one of the reasons why, today, the very idea of large-scale collective insurrection is widely and quite reasonably mistrusted.</p>

<p>As consciousness of race and gender oppression displaces the failed history of class-centric revolutionary projects, to even express interest in large-scale insurrection against inequality and domination <em>as such</em>—rather than framing one’s opposition in terms of specific vectors of oppression—is often seen as suspicious and sometimes explicitly accused of erasing differences between people. The result is that we are increasingly aware of diverse vectors of institutionalized oppression which increase our felt need to overthrow all of them, at the same time we have become deeply suspicious, to the point of preemptively dismissive, of anyone too passionate about overthrowing all of them. Precisely as a generalized insurrection appears more and more necessary, activists are less and less able to speak of, let alone believe in, the very idea.</p>

<p>My argument is that the diverse types of inequality we see today, the complicated distributions of privilege and oppression which characterize modernity, actually <em>increase our collective leverage</em> against the dominant institutions and the small elite which benefit from them, while rendering elite control increasingly brittle in comparison. The main problem is that the diversity which characterizes modern society poses extraordinary interpersonal challenges for which very, very few people have any training or patience, for the understandable reason that our identities today are precisely refractions of the very divisive institutions which dominate and oppress us all differentially.</p>

<p>The reason why almost all the revolutionary projects in history fail or end with terror is precisely because they have always tried to clean an open wound with a dirty hand, over-eager to fix some things but under-concerned with fixing others. Today, in our increasingly information-based existence in which it is possible to know any fact but nearly impossible to live, we have the opposite problem: we are so aware of the dirt on our hands that we don’t believe we can fundamentally heal this collective wound which masquerades as a society. It often seems that because people sincerely don’t want to hurt anybody else, nobody wants to even dream aloud about how one could exercise revolutionary agency in one’s own way, let alone possibly in conjunction with others’ autonomous agency at some point, somehow.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I think that what we need are methods for identifying rigorously the emancipatory pathways available to different people in different situations at different times. It would seem to me that any vision for the possibility of social revolution in a society rife with diverse divisions and hierarchies would need to be composed of heterogenous battle maps for heterogenous situations. These maps should and must be made by different folks for different purposes and there does not need to be any overarching process of verification or legitimation for us to nonetheless wish, hope, and try to make them connect up to whatever degree that becomes possible. The mistake of previous revolutions has been to ask certain groups to wait for other groups; we can affirm everyone’s equal right to immediately do whatever they think most important, and we affirm our desires to attune ourselves to what others want to do, whether we understand it or not, then we can also affirm the dream of a massive and collective abolition of inequality and domination as such, without ever “prioritizing” anyone over anyone else.</p>

<p>What follows in this manuscript might be more immediately useful to those who already have certain privileges and resources which I’m lucky enough to have. I don’t know, one doesn’t know how limited is one’s perspective until one formulates it, until one takes its measure. That is probably an ineluctable condition of anyone thinking or writing anything in the contribution to collective social change. Still, I don’t know, I still believe in the possibility of individuals and groups contributing to the dream and, ultimately, the plan for concretely ushering in an era of real justice and real equality in this lifetime. I believe in at least trying to think through a process whereby diverse groups could aggregate effectively but justly into a massive insurrectionary force <em>toward</em> universal justice, understanding that a truly universal justice would have to be one that is absolutely consistent with all particular identities and desires.</p>

<p>To begin conceptually delimiting a philosophy of intersectional battle maps, of potentially infinite and absolutely autonomous units but facing only the <em>direction</em> of universal, insurrectional unity. We might begin by hypothesizing that wherever tactical opportunities open up in such a fashion that only a relatively small group of people are able to exploit them, that specific small group is a revolutionary <em>avant-garde</em> <em>of that specific front,</em> not by rights or necessity but by chance. No vanguard of “the revolution” or “the movement,” just one of many revolutionary vanguards growing from the logic that the emancipatory opportunities available today are extremely diverse and separated, and contingent on the different positions occupied by different individuals distributed across our hierarchical and divided societies.</p>

<p>And it is no criticism of the individuals first possessed of certain revolutionary perturbations that they are merely “privileged” or “bourgeois” as if that disqualifies them from the resistance. It is a conservative, bourgeois ideology to critique revolutionaries for having a bourgeois background, for not only is it a patently _ad hominem_ argument, it’s effect is to disqualify a faction of society which is sometimes the only faction with the material resources (time, education, technology, etc.), to undertake certain types of activity in certain times or places. Just as there will be crucial types of activity which, I imagine, could only be done by the less privileged. If someone is truly revolutionary, their only function is to spread freedom through contagion from <em>wherever they find themselves</em>, to embody a freedom whose specific nature and function is to proliferate and multiply itself through a process I’ve modeled elsewhere with respect to the political vanguard and according to which the avant-garde will expand just as well.
The simple reason why the avant-garde as well as the vanguard have been critical concepts in art and politics is not because there need to be leaders, as in the disastrously erroneous doctrines of someone like Lenin. The limited quantity of representatives in any emergent avant-garde or vanguard is simply a function of the evolutionary fact that everything has to start somewhere, with some minor perturbation in the system.</p>

<p>In some sense this is good, because perhaps it means the pendulum has swung away from authoritarian tendencies, and perhaps it means that the next massive revolution to shake the world will be constitutionally incapable of lapsing into authoritarian terror. But in another sense, it is clearly a peculiar pathology for an allergy to authoritarianism to become a kind of authoritarian norm precluding the possibility of a generalized explosion of diverse freedoms.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Many people believe it is possible to win a good and just society by organizing a counter-power to change status quo institutions. But when was the last time you heard any convincing argument or up-to-date evidence that this is still the case? Almost everyone who still holds this belief does so as an assumption inherited from some previous era of struggle.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Many people will frankly admit they hold this belief simply because it is necessary to have hope against all odds, but this is wrong: it is necessary to know what is really the case, and anyway, a truthful renunciation of hope is both more joyful and more politically effective than an empirically implausible hope. While many, many people have been trying for a very long time to organize counter-power on the assumption that it exists and only has to be organized, very few people will even consider the idea that total defeat is a possibility, let alone that it may have already happened.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>What if activists and organizers are so concerned with building the best carriage they have failed to notice their horses have already fled?</p>

<p>First of all, <em>if</em> this were the case, there are two reasons we almost certainly would not yet have realized it. The first is that the information revolution has increased the speed of all state and corporate operations much more drastically and much earlier than it did so for any of us. So even if state-corporate domination was officially cemented thirty years ago, it’s perfectly possible we would not yet have received the memo.</p>

<p>The second reason, an endemic pitfall of all activism, is that to grow even a modest movement requires appealing to people, and appealing to people requires activists to peddle hope and optimism <em>despite</em> any changes in the objective conditions warranting hope and optimism. If anything, objective decreases in the conditions for hope lead activists to increase their messages of hope in compensation. It is built into the DNA of traditional “strategic” activism to not honestly update its messaging based on changes in empirical reality. If one takes these two considerations seriously, one begins to see how so many of the activist truisms handed down since the first modern trade unions in the late 19th century are laced with dishonesty and compose a picture of the world no less erroneous for the good intentions of its painters.</p>

<p>The fact is that our “popular” power to control the institutions which govern our lives is now contained, channelled, and otherwise exhausted by political and economic institutions more completely than ever before in the history of the world. On one side we have the global super-rich who move freely and untouchably above all nation states. On the other side, we have the actual human beings of the world who are increasingly overworked, anxious, depressed, frustrated, self-loathing, mistrustful, unequally divided by race, gender, and diverse other categories, locked into the most sophisticated police states ever designed and, despite all of this, on the whole, more zealously invested in the mundane fascism of this everyday life than we were even thirty years ago. In such a fully pacified and one-dimensional world, the idea of organizing and outsmarting the pilots of dominant institutions <em>on the plane of power</em> is a delusional narcissistic fantasy working from a cheap tourist map of political history. I fully affirm the desire and possibility of outsmarting the pilots of dominant institutions, but not by competing upon the very plane which has already been conclusively vanquished.</p>

<p>The next best move in the world history of resistance is at once obvious and difficult to parse. If you lose a game of chess because your opponent moved extra pieces while you weren’t looking, but the cheater is not disqualified because they’re buddies with the referee, what do you? According to the official record, <em>reality</em>, you are a loser but you know that you did not truly lose. So what do you do? Maybe you ask the audience to lobby the referee so they can get their false defeats changed also. While some agree with you, they don’t have the energy for a fight, and the rest just point to the record and correctly say the reality is you lost.</p>

<p>So what do you do? Because governments within capitalism cannot over-regulate all behavior, there are lots of contexts in which you have no power but can still act creatively without imprisonment. This is perhaps the Achille’s heel of liberal capitalism. In this case, since it’s just a chess game and nobody yet gets arrested for poor board-game etiquette, what you do is turn over the table, maniacally excoriate everybody in the room, and leave laughing in a blaze of useless opposition. Not because you have some kind of secret micro-power with which to challenge the referee’s, and not to build a movement to overpower the referee, but precisely because you know the recorded reality is false and  unjust but you desire to live truly despite neither you nor anyone in the audience having the power to do so. Then, only as a by-product of you risking yourself on what you know to be true, lo and behold, on your sad and lonely walk home, a few people from the audience run up to you because they thought what you did was weird and funny and vaguely cool and at the very least not boring.</p>

<p>And you all plan to stay in touch and meet again, and then you start to drift from those old “friends” in the audience who agreed with your frustration but hung their head in shame when you had the nerve to think a silly chess match was a place for life to take place. Then you finally realize that for those people, for the entire audience that is most of society, there is no situation in which it is ever appropriate for life to truly take place, and the only sense of life you ever feel is with those few, new friends you made in your fall from the audience of appropriateness. Then each of you begins to follow up with anyone else who is falling from appropriateness in favor of making life take place. In this way, without going to any bullshit meetings or following any supposedly strategic catechism, only by directly increasing the truth and joy of your life, you find yourself as part of a collective movement at war with everything that is false and unjust. That sad need for hope which is characteristic of activist entrepreneurs vanishes at the point one sets off on the real process of becoming who one is.</p>

<p>This is the only model of activism in any context where institutional domination is so advanced that “organizing” justice seems impossible. Instead of building carriages for an empty stable of horses, we should rather just become horses.</p>

<p>In this fashion, despite the absolute absence of power to change status quo institutions, whatever life still exists inside the dead inertia of the institutional spectacle can find itself and become a collective life-form while the putrid carcasses of the institutions, however much we may remain locked inside of them, can nonetheless be forgotten and left to rot. Although the representatives of the institutions will incorrectly believe they have all the power, this time it is they who will be duped before they even realize it: for despite the continued domination of institutions, everyone will have simply evacuated the plane of their power for ours, the plane of true life.</p>

<p>Of course, dynamics such as these are often killed by a variety of other pacifying pressures emitted by the institutions. Work, debt, bills, certain idiot friends and family members, the general inertia of “path dependence”, all make it hard to fully follow through on such ruptures in the social fabric as that which graced our chess player, those opportunities where one could maybe dodge down some completely new set of relationships, energies, and collective forms-of-life. But that is in large part because we don’t currently see such momentary ruptures for what they truly are, the microscopic but real stuff of which world-historical insurrections can be made. We currently don’t dodge down such paths of becoming because we incorrectly think we have so much to lose within the institutions (all of our status quo investments, typically most of our whole lives’ meanings) and very little confidence that such a risky move would be sensible or coherent, let alone constitutive of a real process of collective liberation.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> In all works such as this little volume of writings, and anytime you and others publicly choose truth and joy over lying and dying, we decrease the hold of status quo fears by increasing the reality of life beyond the institutions.</p>

<p>And with every minor, daily victory of joy over death, we gain a few extra resources—if only of energy—which can be spent on deflecting the pacifying pressures which crush our friends. And we will continue to devise new and different life-forms specifically suited to chip away at these pacifying pressures, lowering the threshold at which others will find it possible to initiate their own liberatory defections and inventions.</p>

<p>The goal here is not to build a theoretical system or a social movement but to demonstrate the theoretically and empirically valid political consequences of certain everyday life options, in order to increase the confidence and frequency with which I and others take the risks necessary to construct collective life amid the institutional deaths we are all currently suffering. As for “unifying” or “organizing,” there is no need; anyone who travels down this path will find each other in the end, not out of some “strategic” catechism some social movement expert wants us to recite, but simply because by doing what <em>actually works</em> to increase truth and joy against the institutions, we will all by definition be moving toward the same destination, only from inherently different and complicated starting points.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Supposedly, the youth are naive and idealistic because they believe in changing the world, until adulthood comes and teaches them the hard lessons of reality. But this is only an ideological fantasy which conveniently assuages the guilt of adults at the same time it deludes and flatters the youth. In fact, for several decades now the youth have been <em>denied access</em> to the naive idealism which is their birthright but for which they nonetheless continue to be mocked. All better to push the youth into an uncritical stupor which was once only imaginable in the  most resigned of the elderly. To make the youth as stupid as adults: education today.</p>

<p>Many of the people who use one hand to mock the youth for their naive idealism use their other hand to stuff the youth with advertisements and work and patriotism and law and order. These odd, hypocritical creatures, these <em>respectable adults,</em> mock the children they themselves have killed.</p>

<p>If indeed the tendency of youth is naive idealism, as I hear so often, then I’d like to know why I never had such pleasures in my own youth. The most naive idealism I ever knew in my youth was American-style libertarianism, Ayn Rand and the cult of “individual rights.” I honestly can’t remember anyone who sincerely and passionately believed in fundamental changes to the dominant status quo institutions. Certainly I knew people who sincerely aspired to do good, and of course the liberal faith in non-profit organizations was not uncommon. But aspirations toward social justice within coordinates defined by currently existing institutions are longings to <em>intensify</em> the status quo rather than fundamentally change it. Such youthful aspirations are not at all naive or idealistic but eminently realistic and practical. So if it’s true that the youth are naive and idealistic, then my generation was robbed.</p>

<p>I blame the <em>respectable adults.</em> It must have been these dubious creatures because no matter how far and wide I look for idealistic youths, all I can find anywhere are <em>respectable adults</em>. They’re everywhere, sometimes even in the bodies of teenagers. And you just <em>know</em> they’re the culprits because when you ask them how things could possibly have gotten this bad, they blame a dozen factors all of which conveniently have nothing to do with their own responsibility, before finally changing the topic to something more “realistic.”</p>

<p>The silent, guilty conscience of the respectable adult has abandoned us—the youth and the not yet capitulated young adults—to a life without compass. And then, as we do our best to navigate the impenetrable fog of lies which we have only inherited, the same respectable adults mock us to discourage us, because to disentangle ourselves would be to disentangle <em>their</em> bad faith. This is why most respectable adults want us to suffer as they suffer, and it is why they really do actively discourage us from seeking liberation, because our liberation would inevitably shatter many of the fragile excuses which they need to make their own shameless complacency livable.</p>

<p>But now, well past the prime of my youth though only at the doorstep of real adulthood, neither have I met with those hard lessons in which reality is supposed to teach me the virtues of reasonable moderation. The only lesson adult reality has taught me so far is that if you’re born into a certain minimum of privilege and work extremely hard, you may be lucky enough to survive in modest comfort so long as you’re willing to invest most of your entire life’s energy into institutions which you know damn well effectively prohibit the very possibility of honest and ethical human co-existence. I would much rather be belittled for my immaturity than admired for a mature bad faith.</p>

<p>It seems the real crisis today has nothing to do with the youth: the real crisis is that we have far too many <em>respectable adults</em> running amok. Just look at them, running around working bullshit jobs, dying from stress and anxiety and guilt, repeating lies they’ve now forgotten to be lies, and bequeathing to the youth an increasingly unsalvageable worldview just to avoid admitting that somewhere along the line they failed and gave up. How much more we would love and respect them if only they could be honest!</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, <em>respectable adults</em> pose no challenge and do not even have to be resisted. As ethical and political deadweights, they need only be forgotten.</p>

<p><em>My</em> only concern is not to become one.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I am trying to express myself in some mode of life as freely as I can, and as wholly as I can, using for my defense the only arms I want to allow myself, arms which are not so much arms as disarmaments, and are for that reason the only legitimate and effective arms available in our world already armed to its teeth: unchecked boisterousness, indiscriminate participation in all things, and naïve transparency. I hypothesize that anyone who holds fast to these rules cannot err. Wherever the dust settles after a whole, naïve, honest soul distributes itself unrestrained into society, it cannot do otherwise than improve that society (and that soul). Unlimited expression, from the launching point of unbiased immersion in all things of the world, abetted by an absolute rejection of all temptation to dissimulation, means nothing other than giving back to the world a true image of itself.</p>

<p>The typical person, on the contrary, consumes the stuff of the world and gives back to that world the same glossy, airbrushed centerfold that made the currently existing world falsely appear desirable in the first place. This corrupt <em>quid pro quo</em> between the individual and society is effected primarily by the individual’s effort to represent itself as better than the horrible shit which constitutes it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Whether they do this for dubious or laudable motives, the effect remains the same. This is the ethos of <em>good people,</em> including and especially the most enlightened and radically good people.</p>

<p>There are three specific mechanisms by which most people—the good, cool, attractive, admirable citizenry—convert their dying society into a semblance of living individuals. They are opposite the three ethical tendencies articulated above. First, a scandalously disproportionate personal preference for <em>silence</em> over honest expression, at once the most discreet and common way to flatter contemporary society by internalizing and concealing all of its nastiest dimensions. Second, the masturbatory romance of <em>exile</em>, motivated by the long-standing but idiotic fantasy that there may still exist some space “outside” of society, a kind of spatial and aesthetic version of silence. And finally, by the sex appeal of strategy or <em>cunning,</em> as if some individual or group will be so clever and powerful as to calculate their way out of this historical nightmare in which instrumental calculation is precisely that which has already hollowed out everything which makes life worth living.</p>

<p>There has never been anything politically progressive, let alone radical, about the citizen who modestly bides their time, reflects on some path to goodness, and then pursues it with intelligent discipline. The radicalism of a particular stance or goal cannot change the fact that all currently existing ways of being good require a fundamentally conservative relation to the world as the price of entry. It is indeed the easiest way to live in compliance with and in active support of the people and institutions which dominate at any point in time. To be a good person is to be innocent in the present, innocent in the view of today’s arbitrary and contingent judges, but to betray the truth of human history inside of oneself and to become guilty in the judgment of future generations who will only wonder why we lied to ourselves. But of course, the alternative is not to be any kind of bad person, as if any kind of badness is necessarily politically progressive.</p>

<p>To help constitute a real and concrete insurrection against oppressive institutions, one must be <em>honestly bad.</em> We must risk ourselves to admit how terrible we are <em>in order</em> to indict the institutions which have generated and deformed us. The personal risk is what makes honest badness a real mechanism of social change, rather than just one more empty gesture in the dead world of representational politics. It is the risk of losing respect and admiration and status quo opportunities in the real assertion of one’s true self that makes this type of communication uniquely capable of constituting real and potentially contagious, radical bonds of opposition and igniting creative expenditures into new worlds. It is what game theorists call a “credible commitment.” The willingness to lose rewards from the status quo implies one must really mean and believe in what one is saying and doing. It is only real risks which inspire others to take real risks and in this way constitute real social movement.</p>

<p>The truth is that I want to do whatever I want at all times, with unlimited resources, and I want recognition for my brilliance and admiration from the entire world. In one sense, with respect to basic morality, this is insane, maniacally egotistical and childishly selfish, but it is nonetheless truly and undoubtedly what I want. I could easily say that I also want all these things for everyone else—and that would be true!—but even that is just an easy way to improve my image on the moral register of representational politics. I truly think all people deserve these things equally and I want to fight for all of us to get them, but the truth is I primarily want these things for myself because I don’t even know most people and I don’t even like a great many of the people I do know. I am truly, in fact, a maniacal child. And really, why wouldn’t I be? Does any currently available type of life trajectory today really provide a plausible pathway through which childhood forms of selfishness are ever able to grow into something more noble? Today, children don’t grow into adult human beings but are merely channeled into compliance by institutions which then reward them with the legitimate label of “Adult.”</p>

<p>Because I want to obtain at least a few things for myself and survive with a little bit of happiness, I simply tell myself that it’s insane to want everything I want and forget the full range of my honest desires, I build a private world of comfort and fantasy regarding my suppressed but heroically simmering greatness, and then I try to be what is called good in order to get along with people, minimize tension, and promote myself. Silence, exile, cunning, and nothing is changed by the fact that I am trying as passionately as anyone to live in dedication to justice and equality for all as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A dedication to social justice can make one even more dishonest. I try to be kind and patient to everyone even if I honestly think they’re ethically pathetic accomplices of hideous evil and boring as hell. Does that make me a good person or a liar? In the accounting books of currently existing institutions, in the order of the recorded spectacle which is the only actually existing reality, I am truly being a good person in defeat of my bad tendencies. I will be liked and trusted and my goodness will bring good things within the current social order. But the ultimate fact is that I am only pretending to be a good person; not only am I in truth merely a selfish and self-righteous child, now I am also dishonest and lacking integrity. Alas, I have joined the ranks of the ethically pathetic accomplices of hideous evil and the boring as hell.</p>

<p>Let us be truly together in the honesty of our evils rather than eternally alone in the falsity of our morals. Let us deface the currency. Anyone who really listens will understand, because they know as well as we that their current life is as sorry as our own. Of course, those who refuse to listen to our truths won’t understand, but what is beautiful about the real movement of history is that the refusal or inability to understand it never prevents one from being swept away. The irony is that in this real movement which cannot do anything other than revalue all values, the ugliness of our honesty will become good and attractive and all currently existing institutions will not be destroyed so much as evacuated.</p>

		<p>The well-known problem with “universal” social theories is they tend to privilege particular social groups over others while pretending to comprehend and represent all groups equally. But to speak of the <em>actual universe</em>—just the whole set of everything that exists in all of its complexity—while that may be a universalism of sorts, it is a universalism by definition without erasure, a universalism which sacrifices no particularity but is rather the universalism <em>of</em> every particular difference. It is only in this sense that I am interested in how the entire set of irreducible differences among us may constitute a universe and, therefore, a minimal but nonetheless universal relation and bond.</p>

<p>In the course of my investigations, I have become convinced that to really understand this universal bond of the particular difference is to unlock an extraordinary <em>tactical</em> insight for the project of human liberation. Pursuing it to its limit produces a revolutionary blueprint allowing for the absolute autonomy of all individuals while also constituting precisely the collective relations characteristic of genuine liberation.</p>

<p>Everything seems to revolve around a kind of unyielding, unapologetic, intensely <em>ethical</em> militancy—an insurrection of the spirit for which joy, honesty, and true meaning are perhaps the only necessary ammunition. But the crucial realization which is the basis for this manuscript is that such notions as joy and honesty are not idealist and fantastical but rather <em>real forces</em> with objectively demonstrable effects amenable to comprehension and political coordination. These forces concretely bend the universe toward its long-run equilibrium of real, true justice.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There is only ever one true north, and it is always the <em>truth of one’s joy</em>, which may just as well be expressed as the joy of one’s truth. Collectively, ours is an infinite vista, an insurrectionary vision unlimited precisely by the practical and ethical failproof that its sole input is free and renewable and its sole target is only ever the already dead, the <em>institutions.</em></p>

<p>In other words, Martin Luther King, Jr.’s famous line about the arc of the universe bending toward justice should not be seen as merely inspiring rhetoric; the model of society which I would like to sketch here produces King’s dictum as an implication or hypothesis; i.e., it is an actual empirical dynamic which, if understood correctly, can be sped up or blocked by circumstance as well as purposeful human action. Currently, those who most understand the actual empirical reality of such dynamics are simply those who are most invested in blocking this tendency toward justice; it is an unfortunate fact that businesspeople and politicians have a more scientifically sophisticated comprehension of social causes and effects than militants and activists. One of my goals is to help rectify this.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

		<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>It is increasingly clear that the dream of a democratic capitalism was precisely that, a short-lived delusion, a fantasy of the three decades after World War II. Ample evidence, which I will discuss later, indicates that the dance of “liberal democracy” has finished. Unfortunately, activists and academics are notoriously bad at updating their positions in response to changes in the landscape. Because we continue to use language from bygone eras, we who are interested in building a better world rely on mental models of social change which are hopelessly inconsistent with empirical reality.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> On the other hand, those academics and mainstream intellectuals who have the most sophisticated and rigorous models of social change tend to be hopelessly invested in the status quo. As a result, certain extraordinary historical changes have flummoxed our ethical <em>and</em> practical compasses in ways which we have hardly even begun to understand. This is why neither the political opposition to status quo institutions nor the frontlines of knowledge have ever been less <em>dangerous</em>: the game is over, we have been defeated by cheaters, and yet we continue playing by their rules because we have lost so badly that we hardly understand what has happened.</p>

<p>What follows in this volume of writings is an effort to rethink and help reconstitute the nature of protest and activism after the difficult admission that ours truly is an age of <em>tyranny</em>, a tyranny which no longer even pretends to negotiate, a tyranny which goes by many names but is as real and formidable and frightening as any of the historical nightmares we’ve always imagined were so far behind us. But don’t worry, there’s no reason to be afraid, for we are already living it and it’s not as if any of the current false optimisms really deliver lasting comfort. On the contrary, it is our refusal to confront the depth of our collective defeatedness which, by blocking sincerity, blocks our path to joy and the collective movement of liberation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this time the tyrannical nightmare of history is more confusing than ever, hence its many names. I have no interest in providing a definitive name for this tyranny, for it manifests with different names at different times: capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy, “corruption,” whatever. As a placeholder, I call our tyranny <em>the institutions</em>, for ultimately the problem is not the humans who appear to have too much power; the problem is that a diverse set of institutions have more than ever in the history of the world taken over human being <em>as such.</em> As we’ll see, those humans who seem the most powerful are actually the least powerful, they are merely the most well paid.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>If you’re already beginning to wonder what my clever solutions are, I would beg you to pause. As it turns out, some potential solutions will emerge, but I’m not selling you anything, so why would I be expected to have solutions? True solutions to political problems emerge only as by-products of honest truth seeking; wherever a solution is offered as a product it is by definition a false solution which will not show us the way. To offer a solution as a product implies an opaque, instrumental relation to the reader, and this squelches the revolutionary capacity of truth-seeking and communication from the outset. One of my larger arguments will be that an instrumental attitude to political ideas—inherited from market institutions—is one of the most insidiously conservative forces because, by decreasing trust in general, it neutralizes the historically revolutionary connections between communication, truth, risk, and collective action.</p>

<p>I am only trying to do what any writer does, but trying to resist as much as possible those falsehoods with which the institutions tempt me. Falsehoods for the market, primarily. I am writing this on the belief that any truly honest and committed unveiling of possibly misunderstood realities is always itself an act of social war against unjust institutions, not only symbolically but concretely. To put it in a way which will become more clear as we proceed, I have a series of thoughts the actual communication of which I see as directly increasing the only truly liberating and insurrectionary forces which I believe to exist: truth and joy. An essential point that will emerge from my perspective is that it is only the absorption of such energies by status quo institutions that neutralizes their inherently revolutionary consequences before we can even embody them. This volume of writings will try to demonstrate this by argument but also by example, for the joy of my own truth is the only thing all these notes will have in common.</p>

<p>For the question is never, “What is to be done?” Already this would make a crucial and symptomatic mistake: to presume I could possibly know what other people should do, or even if I did know, that it would necessarily be collectively liberating to try and direct them! The odor of moralism in so much radical discourse is already too much to bear, I will not add to it. I want all people to flourish, and since I can’t know others well enough to even guess what their flourishing should look like, I will have nothing to say about “what is to be done” by my readers or anyone else. All forms of writing “what is to be done” require such a dose of megalomania that it typically knocks one off the path of collective liberation before even starting. In most thinking and writing, the only worthwhile question is, “What is truly the case?” Why would “radical” political writing be any different? That so much political writing today is primarily about signaling the moral qualities of the writer, and so little of it even pretends to be concerned with the simple goal of trying to understand things correctly—indeed, that to invoke such a traditional concern as veracity is often criticized as apologism—indicates exactly the publicly looming gap into which I have settled my private thoughts for the past couple of years.</p>

<p>My wager is that the collective struggle for human liberation has gone astray for the same reason anything goes astray: we’ve just gotten lost, in a maze of diffuse institutional temptations, psychological traps, and sociological blind alleys which are par for the course in any pacified society at the end of its history. I think we’ve simply become too good at lying, to ourselves and to each other. My gambit, therefore, is the only gambit of any sincerely revolutionary intellectual, and perhaps of any real writer: to collect and share what I honestly think about the entire distribution of all currently existing institutions in whatever fashion seems to most directly participate in the actual movement of their immediate overthrow.</p>

<p>For instance, it always astounds me how people can speak, with a straight face, about “organizing” a “social movement,” as if any of us are even capable of organizing our own lives, as if the very capacity to trust others has not declined dramatically over the past several decades, as if we were capable of having more than a few truly good relationships if we’re lucky! It is comforting to believe that we are capable of a social movement for liberation, but it simply assumes the existence of precisely those human and interpersonal resources which have depleted fatally during the period of our “liberal” pacification.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

Earlier today I released <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/A_Statistical_Analysis_of_Racism_and_Sexism_in_Stand_Your_Ground_Cases_in_Florida_2006_2013/1301532">new statistical evidence of racism and sexism in the enforcement of &ldquo;stand your ground&rdquo; (SYG) laws</a>, using a sample of cases from Florida in the period from 2006 to 2013. A detailed explanation of the data, methods, and findings (including fully reproducible data and code) can be found in the full working paper linked above.</p>

<p>Below, I summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>The two key findings</li>
<li>What if Trayvon Martin had been white? What if Marissa Alexander had been male?</li>
<li>What is new about these findings and why they matter</li>
</ul>

<h3>The two key findings</h3>

<p>1) The probability of conviction for a white defendant against a white victim in a typical case is fairly high at around 90% but with a large margin of error, whereas <strong>the probability of conviction for a black defendant against a white victim approaches 100%, even after controlling for more than 10 different objective factors related to the circumstances of the incident.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Expected_Probability_of_Conviction_by_Race_of_Victim_and_Defendant_in_Stand_Your_Ground_Cases_Florida_2006_2013_/1301534"><img src="http://previews.figshare.com/1880691/860/p_01.png" height="400" width="500" alt="Expected Probability of Conviction by Race of Victim and Defendant in &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Cases (Florida, 2006-2013)" /></a></p>

<p>2) The probability of conviction for a male defendant in a typical domestic case is found to be about 40%, but <strong>for a female defendant in an otherwise objectively equivalent case the probability of conviction increases dramatically to 80%</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Expected_Probability_of_Conviction_by_Gender_of_Defendant_in_Domestic_and_Non_Domestic_Stand_Your_Ground_Cases_in_Florida/1301535"><img src="http://previews.figshare.com/1880692/860/p_01.png" height="400" width="500" alt="Expected Probability of Conviction by Gender of Defendant in Domestic and Non-Domestic &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Cases (Florida, 2006-2013)" /></a></p>

<h3>What these models teach us about recent cases</h3>

<p>1) The probability George Zimmerman was going to be found guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 was marginally greater than 50% but would have been about 98% if Trayvon Martin had been white.</p>

<p>2) Black female Marissa Alexander who fired a physically innocuous warning shot to deter her husband in 2010 faced a probability of conviction marginally greater than 50%, but the probability of conviction for a male defendant in an otherwise objectively equivalent situation would have been around only 12%.</p>

<h3>What is new about these findings and why they matter</h3>

<p>1) The only previous statistical analysis of racial bias in the enforcement of stand your grown laws at the level of individual cases concluded that there has been no racial bias. Conservative gun advocate John Lott analyzed the same data I analyzed and submitted his analysis as testimony to the US Senate Judiciary Committee. As I explain in the paper, his statistical modelswere very superficially reported and deeply flawed. Thus, <strong>my findings overturn the last most influential study which, I believe, incorrectly informed US policymakers.</strong></p>

<p>2) This analysis controls for a very large number of contextual factors which are frequently invoked to dismiss claims of racism and sexism. In other words, if anyone ever says the legal system is not racist or sexist but people of color and/or women are simply more likely to do/be some other thing which rightfully earns them convictions and just happens to be correlated with race or gender, <strong>my study provides evidence of racism and sexism in SYG enforcement even <em>after</em> subtracting out any effect which might come from race or gender correlating with a long list of common conservative excuses</strong>: whether the victim initiates, whether the defendant can retreat, whether the defendant pursues, whether the defendant has a gun, whether the incident takes place on the defendant’s property, whether the victim dies, age of victim and defendant, whether there is physical evidence, whether there is a witness, and whether the victim is committing a crime.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Walking through the city centre a few Saturdays ago, I made eye contact with a thin young blonde girl wearing a huge camouflage army coat and when I did the vague acknowledgment smile thing she murmured something to me which of course I didn’t really hear. I took out my earphones or earbuds or whatever they’re called now, and asked what she said. She was promoting a party thing at a nightclub and, in a strong northern accent, asked if I liked house music. I said I don’t really know, that I’ve heard it before but I don’t really know if I like it. She asked what kind of music I like. I said I don’t know.</p>

<p>“I used to be hip but I’m not anymore,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, you look pretty hip,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh cool, thanks,” I said, looking down at myself thinking “hipster insurrectionary” and wondering if I would ever grow out of it but feeling like no probably not despite, or because, it is a bit absurd to dress in black bloc working at a computer all day.</p>

<p>She said it’s like techno but something something different about beats dropping more or less. I said oh, cool. I neglected to mention that in a previous life, in a faraway land, I was once engaged in a bitter social war against all DJs, against the monopoly they held and continue to hold on the libidinal resources of the youth. She gave me a card thing that would get me in for £5 instead of £7.50, and I said oh cool, thanks. I also said with uncertainty but perfect sincerity—which I was surprised to feel—that maybe I would go. She asked if I wanted a second one for a friend. I awkwardly said, uh no that’s OK, thanks.</p>

<p>“Well look, here’s a ticket so you can get in for free. I can get you free drinks, too,” she said.
I couldn’t tell how old she was, seemed probably between 16 and 27. I didn’t really care about her age so much as the main issue. I asked, “You’re not a student here, are you?” No, she was from Leeds, never went to university, just into house music and stuff. Oh OK cool, I said, that’s cool.
Nonetheless unsure exactly why she was being so nice, when she handed me the ticket I said, “Oh wow, cool.”</p>

<p>Before returning to her party-promoting group about ten feet away, she said to me in a tutorly voice, “Take my number and text me when you get there, and I’ll show you how it works,” as if I had never been to a nightclub ever. Then it dawned on me that she probably just felt bad for me and wanted to help me, this American guy in a minor British city who doesn’t know what kind of music he likes and apparently has nobody to bring along to a nightclub and does not in any part of his self-presentation really appear to be a member of any recognizable milieu but who, now amused and relaxed, says “OK yea, I think I’ll come.”</p>

<p>Walking away, I wondered to myself if I was going to do drugs that night, then I wondered if university lecturers are allowed to do drugs. Then I wondered if I’m allowed to ask if I’m allowed to do drugs, like if I asked someone higher up in the university if I’m allowed to drugs and the answer was no then I would be judged and punished just as much as if they found me on Instagram snorting a line of coke hashtag #idodrugs. I imagined someone later in the night handing me drugs, and me asking them to confirm they are not a student before I quickly strongly thought “this is not going to work.” But then I thought “Timothy Leary” and that made me calm enough to decide I would play it by ear.</p>
