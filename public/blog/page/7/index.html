<p>Barclay Shields: At a time when deeply ideological&mdash;and deeply conservative&mdash;ways of thinking and behaving have become so entrenched, when mechanisms of social control have become so pervasively solidified, the most truly revolutionary life might not even look political. That would be pretending we are still politicized subjects! In an era such as ours, a truly revolutionary life might not even dabble in what is thought of as radical politics, agitation, or organizing, practices which are themselves, especially in their ideologies (of self-sacrifice, discipline, instrumental calculation, personal profit, etc.) so much a function of contemporary bureaucratic capitalism&mdash;but might rather commit to creating a new effectively revolutionary subjectivity that fractures that inert base of contemporary depoliticization in order to once again make political organizing possible. But the specific dilemma I’d like to note is that the bureaucratic, capitalist contamination of contemporary activism and organizing quickly pounce on any freshly radicalized individual, sterilizing everything that is potently, contagiously revolutionary about all fresh converts&mdash;namely, naivete, zeal, impatience, intransigence, and that paradoxically fearless joyousness that always follows from properly lucid realizations of hopelessness. I think this explains my dissatisfaction with currently available forms of political activism and, not to mention, incidentally, feelings you and I have shared about the legitimately revolutionary significance of true love&mdash;how an absolutely committed, defiant, and public love between even two people could be provocatively disruptive if only all the commonly fascist baggage is successfully resisted.</p>

<p>The Bread From One’s Own Mouth: On this topic I certainly agree with much you have articulate to me, both in this current conversation and in those countless others we’ve entertained previously. On this topic I’ve been particularly occupied with the notion of newness, which appears as a foundational point of contact for Hannah Arendt. According to her, humans have the unique capacity for newness, which she calls &ldquo;natality.” Not only is natality humanity’s paramount achievement, it constitutes the primary condition for political engagement. This concept seems especially fitting now, not only as we both attempt to construct for ourselves a revolutionary life-looking, but also within this historical moment, in the shadow of Occupy, the Arab Spring, drone strikes, global capitalism. Although Occupy prompted mass action &ndash; indeed, in some sense it seemed to bring into being a new polis, or public/political space &ndash; it’s time of natality has clearly passed. This became particularly evident, or even inevitable, after the encampments were violently suppressed, which I believe is a major source of its current transition into the more conservative activism that you describe. The political actor no longer feels the vibrancy of this contemporary polis (I say contemporary polis because what was created during Occupy was not only a space for conversation and action, but the whole of human living &ndash; that is, alternative medicinal resources, safety, food, education, etc, which is obviously dramatically contrasted from the Greek polis). How does one construct a similar space of freedom when space is continually, relentlessly, ‘pounced on,’ as you put it, either stifled entirely or simply subsumed by the activist industrial complex? Perhaps more importantly to me, how does one construct such a space without leaving people behind &ndash; not inclusive in the sense of political representation, but one that incorporates friends, family, those against and with whom I constitute myself? Those who perhaps exist on a different political or social terrain than myself, but on whom my freedom is nonetheless contingent? Like my mother, for instance, a woman whose freedom I value as much as mine own, and yet who has vastly different ideas about life-living? My relationship with you, of course, is of a different matter entirely, as a love that is absolutely committed to revolutionary life &ndash; indeed, a love that has become one of the defining characteristics of it!</p>

<p>BS: Right, I think all of that is understandable and I’ve thought some of those things myself. But my fear is that in trying to share our own deeply cherished feelings, positions and visions with others who don’t share them but who might if only we could communicate them&mdash;my fear is that it might practically require such an attenuation of them that it effectively amounts to a betrayal of them. Their authentically lived qualities&mdash;the exuberance and joyously fearless overzealousness I mentioned before&mdash;always gets lost when “politicizing” others becomes the goal of some specific activity rather than the necessary social effect of exhibiting a life as emancipated as possible. In other words, it could be that in the attenuation of energies required even in the simple, specific activity of “sitting down to have a conversation” with one’s little brother or whoever it might be, we are already basically volunteering to omit precisely what is most irresistible and most convincing about our perspective! Namely, that it makes us stand and jump, run in the streets, yell at cops, demand higher wages, demand respect, act out against institutions infinitely more powerful than us, travel, write, cry, all happily, publicly, proudly. It’s precisely these things we fail to do when we go out of our way to organize the depoliticized or educate friends and family. We give them everything boring, unconvincing, and dismissable (“OK Justin, we get it, you’re the youthful idealist in the family, but nothing is ever going to change!” rather than what is irresistible and undeniable (“Uh, what country is Justin in? Ever since that Occupy stuff I haven’t seen or heard from him in years, but he’s always writing crazy shit on the internet… He’s in love, too, it seems? He doesn’t seem to work much or care about anything I care about, he never even pays his bills or debts! Hmm, maybe things are changing…”). In other words, I feel the same things you’ve communicated, but I actually think the best way to care about others is to have as little respect for the status quo as possible, even the status quo that exists inside of them. To love the status quo inside of someone is simply to hate them, sweetly. The best way I can love someone, and refuse to leave them behind, is to live as forwardly, radically, and defiantly as possible. To show them and anyone else who&rsquo;s paying any attention what can be won from fighting for a new subjectivity, something that I think is very much on the table for us, precisely because a radical political subjectivity hasn’t been widely on display or widely available for decades in this country. And finally, I think the difference between the original explosion of the Occupy movement and its sort of post-orgiastic “organizing” agenda currently is precisely this difference: that at first, it was exciting precisely because it heralded an emancipation of everyday life, but as soon as it degenerates back into the status quo of behaviors and practices available and unattractive for years, of course it has lost potency. I suppose it&rsquo;s precisely coming out of this experience that to me, now, the path forward is the selfish-sounding but I think politically and ethically defensible commitment to emancipating myself from the status quo intensely as possible, in order to legitimately become political force rather than trying to organize its absence.</p>

<p>TBFOOM: I think my question, though, is not concerned at all with diverging from a revolutionary life, which by this point both of us clearly and resolutely aspire to and for. However, such a potent decision must content with the absolute fact that such a life does not, purposefully does not, defiantly does not, fit into life itself. It is at once a rejection from life as we know it and the absolute affirmation of life, a new life, a world-building affirmation. And those that cannot bear to reject this life instead sacrifice themselves to it. Sacrifice, in fact, seems to dominate the activist ethos and the activist’s self-image. It strikes me as quite Christian in origin, inherited from martyr narratives. Coincidentally enough, “burning out” is a phrase used to describe the logical outcome of the activist’s sacrifice, which strikes me as superbly reminiscent of a martyr’s burning at the stake, but that is beside the point. It seems clear that the question is not one should prevent burnout, but rather, what is it about the current paradigm of activism that is lending itself to this idea of sacrifice? I would argue that the difficulty of committing to a revolutionary life can be found in its outright rejection of self-sacrifice, and why conversations concerning political activism always return to the boring binary between revolution and reform, both of which ultimately return to the concept of sacrifice: with reformism, that sacrifice takes place in the form of an agreement between the subjects in the state, wherein both agree or consent to the others’ demands. With revolution, that sacrifice is ideally or in theory more short-lived &ndash; and is made in exchange for the outcome of the revolution itself, whether that be equality, the distribution of wealth, death to the aristocracy, etc &ndash; but nevertheless still presents itself as an inevitable component of such. This is where anarchist theory really comes in handy, in that the most basic action to which subjects are called is to live an autonomous and self-sovereign life, a will-full life.</p>

<p>BS: Yeah, it&rsquo;s seems a sort of really insidiously conservative, ideological trap that to do organizing work seems to require the betrayal of precisely the lived reality of one&rsquo;s own desires&mdash;the meetings!&mdash;a betrayal of the sovereign, omnidirectional intransigence that radicalism implies. There is a sort of prohibition on what the radically emancipated fulfillment of one&rsquo;s desires actually looks like, precisely what could be perhaps the most revolutionary and sort of contagious activity, all in the name of trying to empower people who often suffer first and foremost from the forced depoliticization of their desire! It makes sense that contemporary capitalism will tolerate activist organizations so long as they prohibit their members from pursuing or spreading their own committed emancipation! &ldquo;Organizing,&rdquo; the very term, presupposes that the people to be organized are in fact political subjects. But what if the problem is precisely that we&rsquo;ve become so depoliticized that, on some level, we&rsquo;re not even political subjects? If this is the case, then most of what is called activism or organizing is not only going to be consistently and disappointingly unaffective, but it will also be&mdash;convenient for the status quo&mdash;actively repressive of the only activity privilege is good for, namely, unprofitable or we might say antiprofitable expenditures toward the creation of anticapitalist values, i.e. countercultures. And as if this is not convenient enough for the status quo, this particular distribution of priorities currently so common to Serious Radical Activists is reinforced even more by an often knee-jerk and tactically uncritical way of thinking and speaking about privilege. Specifically, we sort of police each other, in our shared disrespect for unfair privileges, into living and behaving conservatively rather than revealing and exhibiting precisely that to which it is such a travesty for us to have disproportionate access! Because we are aware of the injustice of our own privileges, we’ve developed an immobilizing neurosis around these privileges rather than using them to bite the hand the fed them to us. When we modestly “resist” our privileges, we think we are being educated, discipline radicals, but really we’re covering up the crimes of a capitalist distribution. We ought to use our privileges openly and provocatively, living freely and immodestly, irresistibly and politically, not only because we deserve freedom as much as anyone, but exactly in order to politicize a desire for them among those who ought to be up-in-arms for having been deprived them!</p>

<p>TBFOOM: I agree that one cannot simply hope to negate one’s privileges, as they are built on material borders, injustices, and inequalities, but instead one must try to enliven them to their own destruction, so to speak. Along those lines, in questioning the political capacity of the contemporary subject, I am reminded of much of the radical and critical theory written in the past 50 years or so, particularly Judith Butler&rsquo;s work, which sets out to do exactly that: to problematize the subject. I do not think it’s a coincidence that theory is commonly conceived of as, if not the complement to praxis, it’s apolitical antithesis! The oft-exaggerated binary between theory and practice goes hand-in-hand with the outright aggression towards academics, philosophers, and more generally thinkers, which has been increasing over the past 60 or 70 years. What’s happening is a widespread and systematic repression of thinking itself. Yes, thinking, what a seemingly silly concept but one that is dangerously real nonetheless. Not only can we no longer trust in the existence of a subject equipped for politics, we can no longer taking for granted that there is a politics towards which subjects can turn to at all. There needs first to be the possibility of politics to occur. This is why I find that much political philosophy is no longer useful, despite it’s long tradition that began, arguably, with Plato. The question that needs to be asked now is not what one’s utopian model of democracy looks like, and then setting about to cast subjects towards this model, but instead questioning the very possibility of politics &ndash; and a political subject &ndash; entirely.</p>

<p>* 
Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Jane Henrietta. She was a very angry young child, never listening to any kind of authority figure who crossed her path. One morning, she woke up and said “Fuck this shit, I’m going to go smash some windows.” On her way to the window store, she ran into 15 girls on bicycles. A girl gang. Jane Henrietta had no idea what to do. At first Jane Henrietta felt scared and she felt sort of full with hatred but then she also felt full of love and wanted to be in the girl gang. She realized that the hatred she had for the young women was due only to herself not being in the gang. So she thought she might be welcomed into the gang if she went to the window store and was sufficiently provocative and radical in her destruction of the windows.</p>

<p>“Hey you,” said one of the girls, the biggest one of all. “You have to be a feminist if you want to run with us.” Jane Henrietta didn’t know what a “feminist” was. She had only seen them on TV, huge bear-chested women, burning men alive on stakes. The idea sort of appealed to Jane Henrietta, and she agreed.</p>

<p>And so Jane Henrietta proceeded to the window store. When Jane Henrietta arrived at the window store where she originally planned to destroy windows, she realized that it might make more sense in the intermission to be a practically effective feminist, getting a job at the window store instead of breaking things. So she went to the counter, and she requested an application. She then left the store and on her way home she ran into the gang of young women on bikes. One of the girls who saw her exiting the window store with a job application shouted epithets at her, something to do with politics or something like “capitalism;” Jane was scared and confused.</p>

<p>Little did the girls in the gang know, Jane Henrietta only picked up the job application to murder the store manager, a large burly man who had no values, no morals, and certainly no politics. Jane Henrietta got the job at the window store. And she began to concoct a plan, a very simple one indeed: at the end of her next shift, she would sprinkle a fine poison into the store manager’s coffee, which he had at the end of every day. This poison was so rare, it only existed in the depths of West Virginia. Jane Henrietta, having grown up there, knew exactly where to get it. In fact…she had a lifetime supply.</p>

<p>Jane had heard whispers around the store that a new technology for window production was about to be adopted by management. The rumors were that all of the employees could lose their jobs due to the superior production power of the window technology, but Jane Henrietta wasn’t afraid. She was not afraid of the window technology not because she thought she could do a better job or she could make windows faster or because she felt productively or economically superior to the window technology, but because she didn’t give a shit about the job and she didn’t really care if you did a good job or not, she didn’t really care how many windows she produced.</p>

<p>The new technology prove to be perfect for her plan. Sheer perfection. It produced windows in such a way that if a person were to fall into the machine…they would never be seen again. On her first training shift, her burly, sweaty boss was showing her around the new equipment. “This is how you do it, sweetie,” he said. “You just stick this here and stick that there and then you got a window.” Jane Henrietta despised him. She despised the way he called her sweetie, with sweat glistening on his upper lip. At the end of the shift, she turned and said, “Mr. Manager? Can you come over here?” He came over, his back to the open machinery and she knew this was her chance. She pushed him into the machinery, and as his body was flying backwards Jane Henrietta screamed “Anti-capitalism!!!!!!” As his body was slowly sucked away by the dominant hegemonic machineries of globalization and Western patriarchy, Jane Henrietta knew she did her job. The next day, she asked for a raise.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/08/04/becoming-adult/" itemprop="url">On the social contract of entrance into adulthood</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The popular ideological notion of “growing up,” as an account of the transition from youth to adulthood, is the reverse of the truth. We say that the young person is naïve and silly, and that the process of growing into adulthood entails setting aside the immature unboundedness of youth and generally “settling down” morally (into the sturdiness of lifelong conviction), politically (into the conservation of order), socially (into the duties of family life), and economically (into a stable and respectable occupation and work ethic). Of course, this is understood as progression, from an uneducated and unrealistic dreamworld to a strong, noble reckoning with the facts of life.</p>

<p>But, in reality, the movement from the energetic and yearning dreamworld of youth to the bitter settledness of adulthood is certainly regression. Literally: organic decay. “Settling down” implies not only the complacency of taking a rest, of giving up one’s youthful ideals, but a “settling” of one’s debt with the universe. The energy that sustains one through youth, an energy borrowed from the universe in the form of food, drink, societal support, etc., must be paid back at some point; one could take it all and run with it but this is strictly discouraged by elders through a variety of means.</p>

<p>In fact, most of the privileges accorded to a proper “adulthood” are only accorded to those older children who will once and for all commit to abandoning the truths of their youth. In this sense, the “social contract” is not as abstract and mythical as we often imagine: it is “signed” by the youth who commits to what society calls adulthood.</p>

<p>Because the planet is naturally dominated by those who are closer to death than birth, a great deal of ideological resources are funneled into squelching youthful vitality at the earliest possible stage. Our notion of growing up, which reverses the true nature of the movement from youth to death, is only one small but stunning example of how conservatives (conservators, really) tame revolutionary forces of creative energy.</p>

<p>We must maintain the energy, playfulness, and incredulity of youth all the way into our adulthood, where, betraying our contract with a wretched civilization, we will combine the innocent destructiveness of incredulous energy with the properly adult maturity of autonomous self-discipline. In other words, we must learn how to craft lives which can, in their course, <em>follow through</em> on the truths of youth. All of the advanced knowledge-powers, all of the tacit and acquired skills of “serious” social role-playing, and much of the esteem and respect accorded by adults to adults, are typically granted only to those who sign the social contract by abandoning the zealous incredulity of youth. But our social relations today are so flimsy and shallow—composed primarily of job interviews, bank loan applications, and internet memes—that this implicit contract is easily cheated. Indeed, the future will belong to these cheaters of the status quo, we noble cheaters.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/07/31/28368602901/" itemprop="url">#11: The essential structure of institutions</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>When the human thing enters the cave and enjoys shelter from the snow, it enters into an <em>institutional</em> relationship. An institution is any ensemble of which at least one of its constituent and constituting things is a human. Whenever the human enters into a relationship with a thing or multiple things, we say it is <em>institutional </em>because from the plain of immanence it does not simply exist but is also <em>instituted</em> insofar as the human is the space of the name, of designation. As soon as it enters the cave, it receives some things (in this case, the intensive thing of safety and the extensive thing of a physical cover) from the status quo. But in receiving some things, it necessarily <em>owes</em> some things. In this most simple example, it’s debt to the status quo is nothing other than the simple reciprocation of maintaning the cave. The human cannot take cover from the cave and also physically destroy it. Obviously this has nothing to do with some contract or moral obligation to the universe&mdash;we have no reason to believe in such idiotic contrivances&mdash;and <em>debt</em> itself is only a rather tardy metaphor. But we see in this most primitive of institutional relationships that, on the formal, logical level that is reality, if the caveman wants to continue to live, by the very definition (and designation) of his life he can do whatever he pleases so long as he does not eliminate from existence that which enables him to live. The institution is the most basic model of a debt relationship and in this particular example it is easy to imagine concrete reality functioning as an original, built-in enforcement agency. Other things equal, if X requires Y to live and Z is that thing which delivers Y, then X owes Z at least enough for Z to continue existing. If, rather than “paying back” Z by respecting its thinghood at least enough for it to continue existing, X “defaults” on the debt owed to Z by using his newfound safety to, say, chisel away at the walls until they collapse, X will be promptly punished by death. The simple institution as a primitive model of debt relations is just as easily understood as blackmail: “You’re cooperation or you’re life,” says the cave!</p>

<p>This pure form of the institution assumed other things were equal, but as soon as we imagine an environment including other variables, it is not long before we are capable of spinning out all of modern economics. Thus, we can now incorporate into our portfolio of discplinary metaphors that of economics. Of course, it will be a long time before that institutional environment which makes possible such a transparent terminology as that of modern economics. This transparency of terminology for understanding institutionalized life could only emerge <em>after</em> life becomes sufficiently institutionalized. Too early in the institutionalization of human life, this vocabulary would have led to revolutionary upheavals against <em>institutionalization as a form of social relation</em> so obviously based on the blackmailing of humans by things. </p>

<p>If we modify the previous model to include the possibility of an alternative shelter, W, we quickly understand that it would be possible for X to take Y, default on Z, and simply move to another shelter. Of course, our human does not fundamentally escape the debt relation that he has no choice but to enter into with an inanimate thing, it only emancipates itself from one by displacing its investments into another. To anticipate, this is a premonition of a hypothesis advanced by the geographer David Harvey, a hypothesis we will return to much later, that capitalism never solves but only displaces its crises. More radically, existence itself has the structure of precisely such a shell game, as modeled and diagrammed earlier (Figures 1-4). What seems perpetually at stake, ontologically no less than economically, is that every thing that exists at any point in time cannot help but “owe” its existence to some uknowable surplus  at the origin of all proximate, knowable origins.</p>

<p>For the purpose of bringing the basic framework to a satisfactorily working completion, it suffices to observe how within our framework economic terminology blends into that of evolutionary and physical theory. All things <em>borrow</em> from some other thing, <em>invest</em> it into some distribution of other available things, but must by definition pay their debts to that which gives them existence. We could just as well say that highly massive ensembles lend energy to new, smaller things which are<em> forced </em>to pay back the larger ensemble. We could just as well say that paying one’s debts is always naturally selected by any currently existing ensemble or, alternatively, anything which fails to pay its debts to those things that lend it its existence are naturally unfit from an evolutionary perspective.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It will be objected that the web of language means words in fact have very high density, all of them having so many plugs in common. But the error here is to suppose that all words exist at all times in some ether. The density of words is potentially extraordinary, but only if they are mobilized. Thus, a tome of philosophy is capable of formidable density—for those who can, with the author, mobilize the whole web of words into and out of which the tome plugs, a book is capable of possessing a mass that literally exceeds that of the Earth. Any honest intellectual will not only testify that it is truly possible for a book to move the Earth, but moreover that the experience is easily understandable as one of <em>acceleration</em>, exactly what the model here suggests. How else has this outstanding and almost unbelievable capability of words, this power that a highly evolved social system has made sure to reveal only to an extremely small intellectual aristocracy and only after its members promise not to share the secret—how has this capacity of words ever been satisfactorily explained?</p>

<p>Had humans ever once in their whole history developed word-things with a greater mass than the whole ensemble of things that generated humans, the ensemble of things would select against it. How? It is the image of a philosopher who forgets to eat because he or she cannot stop writing. Who would seek to produce word-things of such mass, at almost any stage of human history, would literally die trying. For most of human history, the selection pressure or mass of things overpowering the centrifgul tendency of word production has been directly and brutally “natural.” Vital needs easily hold it back. Today, when vital needs, for some, have been taken care of in certain regions of the world, and information technology makes word-production unprecedentedly cheap, it is <em>actually possible</em> to write books that would destroy the whole world as we know it. But through a complex evolutionary history we will try to trace, evolutionarily-selected and highly massive things called <strong>ideology</strong> remain to prevent human societies from destroying themselves in this fashion. However, as civilization approaches other potentially catastrophic pressures on the horizon, the mobilization of word-mass into the overhaul of things now encounters selection pressures in its favor, a dynamic to be discussed at much greater length later in this work.</p>

<p>Thus, all things have masses and the comparison of masses explains why certain random mutations are “selected.” Ensembles with greater mass “select,” according to evolutionary theory or, in a register of pseudo-physics we could say they pull toward themselves, new things with less mass. The human is evolutionarily fit and is selected or integrated or pulled into the orbit of things preceding it because it produces a new kind of thing (maps, words) without exceeding the mass of the things that precede it. Whenever humans produce books with masses that exceed that of the Earth, the Earth literally accelerates toward the book, a previously ineffable experience to which any honest philosopher can testify. However, the specification and distinction of particular ensembles characterized by variables of mass is itself subject to selection pressures or relationships of force.</p>

<p>It is only possible at any particular time to distinguish ensembles in a way that is evolutionarily fit. This accounts for what is called ideology or false consciousness, because <em>a priori</em> there is no essential necessity sanctioning a conceptual organization of the world that is merely evolutionarily fit at a particular, contingent point in natural history.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The diagrams of Figures 3 and 4 each capture five things characterized by three sources (input arrows) and three sinks (an original and two tangential splits); one thing with four sources and four sinks; and one thing with two sources and two sinks. Here, <em>volume</em> is equal to the <em>diameter_of the thing, and </em>density<em> is equal to the number of plugs (sources/sinks). The mass of an ensemble is then equal to its volume multiplied by its density. </em>A priori<em>, there has been no reason for modeling purposes to vary the the theoretical diameter of the particular energetic circles constituting thinghoods because, </em>ceteris paribus<em>, every thing has equal diameter. The volume of things increases only when they enter into ensembles (either material connections or conceptual generalities). Thus, the volume of an ensemble (diagramatically, the sum of all diameters) is equal to the number of things that compose it, and the density of an ensemble is equal to all of the plugs uniting its things. This also implies that any thing whatsoever will have a variable volume and density depending on how the ensembles are distinguished, that is, how they are named. The difficulty is that names, as things, are no less subject to these forces than any other things. This will be the essence of what the Marxist tradition knows as </em>ideology<em> or </em>false consciousness._</p>

<p>Thus, the name-things displayed in Figure 4 were chosen for merely illustrative purposes as a rough approximation of an ideological conception of things that has become almost universal in the history of the West. Humans are conceived as being minor, recently evolved creatures on the periphery of a core ensemble known more or less as nature. The world is a thing that humans made as a concept that encompasses the whole ensemble of known things, but they did not make it any way they pleased. They made it in the only way that was evolutionarily feasible, and the only way that has ever been evolutionarily permitted to word-things, i.e. as having high and even extraordinary volumes (diameter) but very low density.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Myth is a founding lie or fantasy that is necessary to structure the present in the absence of true knowledge of actual origins. Just as the present’s coherence requires an unreal structuration from the past, so too does it need an unreal structuration from the future. There are many options whereby societies collectively negotiate a conception of the future that serves to structure, stabilize, and give meaning to the present. The well-known Enlightment theme of perpetual <em>progress</em> is only one example. When progress fails or perhaps “pauses,” a common alternative is <em>nostalgia</em>, the structuration of the future by a mythic past. This latter attitude is particularly pathological insofar as the openness and potentiality of the human future is limited and constrained by a circular investment of the future into the past, the boundlessness of future possibility absurdly choosing an already dead past. Rothko loathed nostalgia, he told us this very clearly.</p>

<p>Given the interpretation outlined here, one is struck by the very last piece in the <em>Catalogue.</em></p>

<p><em><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6teu9buQH1qz9517.png" alt="" /></em></p>

<p><em>Untitled</em>, 1970 60 ¼ x 57 1/8 (152.4 x 145.1).</p>

<p>Right after the “Black on Grays,” after all the bright lines, a bright red canvas with two blurry lines establishing two unequal blocks. It is 1970. It is the Cold War. It is Communism versus Capitalism. It is the United States. It is a Russian Jew in the United States. It is a good leftist Russian Jew in the United States during the Cold War. It is the color of blood, the color of the Communist spectre haunting not just Europe but the world, and to some, for better or worse, it is the color of a different future. Coincidences, of course.</p>

<p>However, what is the terminological placeholder for that which is to the future what myth is to the past? Historically, the dream of <em>revolution</em> is to the future exactly what myth is to the past. It is the radical difference between what is exists in the present and what is to come, a radical difference that functions structurally in the same was as the mythic past, giving meaning and impetus to human striving. Of course, the point is not that any artist should have thrown his or her weight behind the authoritarian Soviet Union of the 1970s, but it must be recognized that one responsibility of the truly autonomous person, the artist, is to defend at all costs the openness of the present, for the nature of the space onto which the present opens is the space of creation itself. Revolution being the signifier for the absolute openness of the future, a potentially radical difference that cannot strictly be known or proven, it is simply the name for the only non-nostalgic modern or postmodern myth available for the structuration of present times, times which have been so aggresively hallowed of all spiritual, ethical, and social significance. Thus, after the rigorously and insistently subtractive color fields, after the increasingly ruthless, dark, black-gray, black-blue, sparse canvases with harsh lines, a blast of red with two murky lines susceptible of dissolving at any moment, two precarious threads holding apart two unequal blocks of the same color. Modern painting gives us the rigorously reduced essentials of form, but in his very end, in his last breath, Mark Rothko leaves us with the reminder that the ground zero of indistinction to which a certain current of modern painting aspires finds its dialectical culmination in a certain revolutionary upshot, in an acknowledgement that arriving at ground zero is only the negative activity toward a bright future of radical recreation, of equality, of dissolved egos, the negative activity of revolution itself, a block or bloc of color for which we should not be afraid to draw our lines.</p>

<p>The critical development of reduction, of peeling away the inessential, demands at the end a turn, a leap into the future. At the end, the truth demands that one avow some unreality to structure the present if the present itself is not to become deceptive. The error would be to reduce reality to nothing, which it surely is, and to just stop there: one flat block of black, suicide, where Rothko’s canvases were for a long time heading, and where Rothko himself ended up, but not before a last gasping breath at the myth of a future. Reality is certainly nothing in the final analysis, but one never gets to the final analysis, for the recognition of the nothing is itself the dialectical spring into the future, into action. “Art is not only a form of action, it is a form of social action,” writes Rothko, “For art is a type of communication, and when it enters the environment it produces its effects just as any other form of action does.” If this is true, modern painting for us should serve as a sort of visual springboard into the radical activity space onto which art opens when properly understood. The requirement of drawing a line and the right to starve by it. That these are the only two remaining vestiges of artistic autonomy is what modern painting demonstrates most radically if we are only able to understand it correctly. That final red painting in the Rothko catalogue is a painterly paraphrase of Marx’s well-known dictum that the workers have “nothing to lose but <a href="">their</a> chains.” The artist has nothing to lose but his or her current castration, and everything to gain within lines purely of his or her own drawing, the lines of any properly revolutionary wager.</p>

		<p>If one has never drawn a line, one does not even exist. But if one has the honesty to present nothing more than the line itself, one not only exists but also honestly and transparently dramatizes that simple self-assertion is the only requirement of a true human life. One of the aims of Rothko’s ouvre, in my reading.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we can say to a certain extent that the paintings of Rothko provide a formal framework for the ethical manipulation of formal, visual distinctions as arguably the only truth available in the art of late capitalism. In particular, the strategic imperative to <em>take without giving</em> implies a certain ethics or directionality for the kind of formal manipulation of distinction that is the color field painting: the perpetual reduction or subtraction of distinctions that we do, in fact, observe in Rothko’s development. This perpetual reduction or subtraction of distinctions, illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 but easy to observe throughout Rothko’s whole career, implicitly moves toward a universal generality the culmination of which would be the absolute absence of distinction. This is nothing less than the classic value and ideal of equality—the absolute ground zero of indistinction.</p>

<p>But we have also seen how the existence of at least one line is an absolute necessity for a thing to exist, and certainly for the human being to exist as a free, responsible subjectivity.</p>

<p>To summarize the problem or question that seems to structure Rothko’s experimentation, we can recast it as a basic tension or paradox. On the one hand, Truth is a movement toward absolute indistinction—dissolution of the false, unreal market-generated stratification of individuals, groups, and works of art—the perpetual removal of lines between things and people. But on the other hand, to exist and stand as a truly autonomous human subject against a false and unreal society requires one at some point to somewhere draw a line against it, to say this is where one stands, at any cost, against the status quo. This accounts for the long-run tendency of Rothko’s canvases to become increasingly sparse in composition, as well his fascination with the separating lines of the “Black on Grays.”</p>

<p>What this means for us, moving forward, is that legitimately and properly free human activity—the province of the artist as well as the philosopher—must be concerned with nothing more than the drawing of lines and the right to starve by them. Of course, this is not to suggest that the space for experimentation has narrowed, quite the opposite! Within the lines the individual or group draws against the market and the society that seeks to dissolve everything into its hiearchy, there is an infinite world of experimentation, a space far wider and deeper than the possibility space of those who seek success in the dominant hierarchy of the art market. Under today’s conditions, anything less than an absolute declaration of distinction between oneself and the status quo, a declaration of solidarity with others who have pledged distinction from the same status quo, and the right to starve together—anything short of this is the opposite of creation, it is the opposite of true and active life, it is the melting of one’s skin into a canvas one never even participated in painting but that is painted by others who control you and paint on you. This emotional experience, the late modern experience of one’s freedom being passively, slowly melted or sort of finely chopped-up by a vast and mystified expanse of false, alien choices and foreclosed pathways—this, I believe is the emotional core of the early Rothko’s <em>Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea:</em></p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6tdrwATJa1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To proliferate artistic content in exchange for money is, in a sense, to melt, to disintegrate, to effectively die as an “I,” as the borders of oneself are literally traversed and eroded by the swirling shards of the status quo, by the circulation of money, by so many little sharks or boomerangs or arabesques or pins sewing loops in and out of one’s nervous system, in and out of the bulbous organs of the body literally formed by the circular interaction of economy and individual, as the artist literally becomes nothing more than a slow swirl at the edge of the sea—a sea of money—ultimately making it impossible to identify where the one stops and the other begins.</p>

<p>An objection will be raised to the effect that Rothko explicitly understood his color fields as participating in the grand tradition of <em>mythic</em> painting. It would seem that this is inconsistent with the interpretation elucidated presently, myth seeming to imply a grand, latent meaning rather than the mere formalism of the manipulation/reduction of distinctions. This is true, but Rothko was also interested in reducing myth to its bare essentials. For Rothko, I believe, this project of developing a mythic dimension in painting that was properly modern meant the development toward a <em>non-nostalgiac myth</em>. I do not think Mark Rothko attained this sort of teleological endpoint that I argue is implicit in his theoretical and practical development, but I would like to consider this question in light of a theoretical reflection on myth and nostalgia, concepts with which Rothko was notably concerned, and with reference to one of his last canvases.</p>

		<p>In the year before he would die by his own hand, Rothko painted a series of acrylics known by art historians as the “Black on Grays.” From my perspective, hitherto the critical reception of this series has been altogether confused. As the <em>Catalogue Raisonné </em>summarizes:</p>

<blockquote><p>…nearly every visual and thematic strategy that critics have affiliated with these pictures is a trope of disenchantment or distance. They are as follows: they resemble moonscapes, the white margins are an alienating bid derived from taping down the works on paper (by foregrounding this devise the compositions thematize the process of artistic production) or prompted by the borders that Rothko noticed around reproductions of his own work; comparable margins were being used by Malcolm Morley and others at the time so as to ironize the subject of representation; the inchoate brown smears, squiggles and drips in the lower half are a careful affront to the pristine shine of the white acrylic…To conclude: blocked or drastically mediated vision disables intimacy and the very rules for the spectator’s engagement that Rothko himself had set.</p></blockquote>

<p>Funny how critics seem go so far out of their way to be incorrect. Only to academic art critics can blocks of color placed atypically close together be perceived as suggestive of distance, drastic mediation, or ironic detachment. Sheer claptrap. The tightness of the color fields pressed together rather than separated as in most of Rothko’s paintings and the stark parsimony of hue combined with applications of white that directly accentuate, not step back from, the point of contact between fields—it seems perfectly obvious that these features are consistent with, and perhaps the apotheosis of, the project of achieving an evermore honest subtraction of the ideological filler that occupies the gaps between the only essential human verity, namely, the line-drawing function of the free human being. Everything in these paintings points to the real, unironic, inescapable, irreducible, palpable primacy, in the final analysis, of the <em>line</em>.</p>

		<p>Rothko was a painter who effectively declared that if the cost of artistic freedom is having to satisfy so many people and circulate the work of art through what is so painfully, obviously, a truthless and exploitative economy that is at once vulgar <em>and</em> elitist, then the only defensible direction is to <em>take without giving</em>, to reduce, subtract, and destroy everything inessential; if the artist is to be hemmed in on all sides by a systematic and dispersed arrangment of masters, then to the devil with the dream of representation and, even more radically, to the devil with any transmissable positive content whatsoever, to the devil with the fantasia of possessing an object, to the devil with deliverance. Just as a prisoner who is locked away and denied a right to petition his confinement might paint his cell with blood simply to inscribe in history the fact of his oppression no matter the likelihood that this signature will go unnoticed, the painting of the modern painter bears witness to the impossibility of true artistic freedom under late capitalism, no matter the likelihood that it will be sterilized and co-opted by its cash value. The simple unadorned spectacle of distinction itself, of separated fields of color, of discrete, blocks, lines and edges are the vain scream of artists whose every way is blocked, who—being unable to paint honestly a David overcoming Goliath at a time when such a legitimate and powerful mythic representation has no defense against immediately becoming its opposite, namely billboard apologia for David himself—who shout, silently: “This is this, that is that, there is there, here is here, this is where I stand, and I can do no other.”</p>
