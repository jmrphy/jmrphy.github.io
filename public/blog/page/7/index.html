		<p>“But an animal does not feign feigning.” – Jacques Lacan, Écrits_ </p>

<p>The <em>human</em> is what emerges when an ensemble randomly generates an <em>idea.</em> An idea is a thing noteworthy only because the idea-thing is not <em>already</em> a thing; it is a lie, a thing supposed into existence precisely because it does not exist, a becoming. An existing ensemble falsely priding itself into a new existence by the false implication that there is some-thing outside of existing. A human emerges when existing things successfully bring into existence a thing that does not physically exist (namely, the “physical world”) by generating another thing that so obviously doesn’t exist (the idea), that by comparison the first thing seems to truly, physically exist. In other words, the human is the animal that produces a plain of immanence as a space of limitless action, an eternal smorgasboard, an all-you-can-eat buffet of nothing, an infinite reservoir of natural gas.</p>

<p>A <em>plain of immanence</em> is the ground of intensive space. In other words, for most intents and purposes, it is the ground of the symbolic dimension, the non-spatial space in which thought takes place and signification is possible. It is not essential to know the answer to such inane questions as when exactly this space opens up or whether dolphins are philosophers no less than humans. It doesn’t matter. It is only for lack of courage,  independence, and material incentives that at this point such complexities would lead many bourgeois political theorists to hesitate and perhaps even abandon ship. The truth is there is no need to be concerned about the thousands of minor curio we could raise about the <em>when</em> and <em>who</em> or even the exact <em>what</em> concerning the precise emergence of conceptual space. All we need to affirm is that it exists, it’s been produced as a thing, an intensive thing that in turn produces other things, and that these things have a nature we are capable of describing and modeling.</p>

<p>The plane of immanence is that ground from which symbols and concepts are spun through intensity rather than extension. Intensive things by their nature have no physical existence: dreams, memories, thoughts, feelings, emotions, all intensive things, which are no less real things for lacking physical existence. Most people incorrectly imagine intensive space to be inside of their heads, but this is obviously wrong. Precisely, <em>intensive space</em> is the negative space of things. Because all things are only variably stable loops of energy, the very nature of things implies or produces a thing other than the thing-in-itself. Although intensive space has no physical existence, it can be mapped. Indeed, the emergence of a plain of immanence in the negative space of the physical thing is the condition for the possibility of mapping. Thus, the best way to think about the plane of immanence is to think of the surfaces associated with artists and intellectuals: paper, canvas, marble, etc. All of these things, in the way that artists and intellectuals employ them, begin as physical things with absolutely zero inherent “meaning” until a human picks them up and uses them to model or map things that then come into a real being no less real on account of its intensiveness.</p>

<p>The plain of immanence is to intensive space what the Earth is to the human bodies living on it: that which permits the possibility of jumping or ascending. Perhaps the best illustration of the plane of immanence is a blank sheet of paper, pressed, flat, physical matter that offers itself to the eye and on which ink can produce something rather than simply spill its own matter. Ink spills on the paper (extensive thing) and it writes on the plane of immanence (ground for the production of intensive things). Although, it should be noted that the plane of immanence is no more an intensive thing than energy itself is a physical thing: both are only theoretical concepts (mapped intensive things) physically made on physical things (symbols, diagrams on paper, etc) as the production of intensive things. The sheet of paper is only a model of the plane of immanence, while the writing as production of intensive things exists only in the intensity of the negative space of physical words, sentences, diagrams,etc.</p>

<p>The human is simply the name of the thing that, when a plane of immanence is randomly generated, dwells inside of it; it is that which literally exists within the negative space of things. The human is its body without organs, the animal that seeks shelter in a cave by becoming an animal that seeks shelter in a cave. </p>

<p>Our philosophical anthropology therefore stumbles like an idiot into one of the only compelling explanation of early cave paintings systematically integrated into a theory of human nature. The animal who draws a buffalo on the inside of a cave is simply doing what they are doing. Artistic genius converges with the sheer uselessness of tautology. In instinct, an unmapped intensity, the animal simply finds shelter or dies. Some find it and live, some fail to find it and die. In the drive, the human version of the instinct, the animal seeks a thing for doing some other thing. That is, it maps the negative space of things (the “meaning” of falling snow, which is that it threatens). It lives if it performs a certain “naturally selected” map of things (walks the line from outside the cave to inside the cave because snow is drawing threatening lines to the ground, and dies if it performs a naturally inopportune map of things (draws a line from itself off a cliff, say). Thus, the human is not so much entering a natural shelter but instead producing shelter as an intensive thing out of a physical thing and climbing inside of it. When it enters the dark cave as the lone animal who lives on a plane of immanence, and for survival must produce maps or models of intensive things, it is actively drawing the animal that draws itself. Why it paints the buffalo requires no solution because there is no problem: it is simply continuing to do what it was already doing and will never stop doing. The real theoretical question is why it will come to paint so rarely.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/06/29/26168279973/" itemprop="url">#4: Natural selection, random mutation, the material world</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The logic of <em>natural selection </em>given <em>random mutuations</em> of ensembles, explains the existence and extinction of ensembles over time. When we conceptualize the circuitry of thinghood according to electrical engineering, we court the error of thinking that energy is something manipulated by the menu of options known to the electrical engineer. Just as Darwin illustrated the theoretical gains to be had by dispensing with God as the designer of everything, we should, for the same reasons, theorize energy as subject to “random mutations.” We will account for the evolution of things by showing that at any point in time, those ensembles that succeed in existing are simply the the random energetic mutations which happen to thrive given the conditions in which they emerge.</p>

<p>Thus, let us consider a simple model of the natural, “material” world. Things are connected to other things in an eco-system of consistencies—a river links to an ocean from which evaporated water links to a sky of clouds from which rain produces the river, and so on—in a more or less stable, circular configuration that perpetuates itself. If the stability of an ensemble is inherently centripetal insofar as it is defined by perpetual orbit around a center of gravity, the notion of random mutation implies a corresponding centrifugal tendency. More rigorously, we should say that existence implies what is known as centripetal force, while change (<em>metabole</em>) implies what is known as centrifugal force. Indeed, the Greek term <em>metabolismos</em> means “outthrow.” The world is simply an ensemble of diverse things characterized by a more or less “hard core” of  well-connected and re-enforcing things nonetheless constantly spinning energy “outward” in random mutation. In the diagram below, the right-most thing in the ensemble represents a random mutation.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6efp2tlmh1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The fate of the random mutation, whether it will be permitted to exist (persist), is soley a function of whether or not it thrives given that which already exists. The integration of a random mutation into a thing that exists over time is thus sheer subordination of a new part to the whole. If a random mutation does not happen to fulfill the strict conditions of what the currently existing ensemble happens to permit, it simply goes away. It goes extinct. We say natural selection implies the subordination of the new part to the whole because mutual-exclusivity of the conditions for existence between a random mutation and the ensemble from which it emerges seems to never result in the larger ensemble going extinct. In any event, the law of the conservation of energy does not imply a law concerning the conservation of things.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/06/10/67/" itemprop="url">Is there really a school-to-prison pipeline?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>1. Can we really say there is a school-to-prison pipeline? And if so, what&rsquo;s &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; it?</strong></p>

<p>The notion of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline">school-to-prison pipeline</a> is increasingly popular in the discourse of a wide coalition of U.S. activists fighting mass incarceration and defending public education. The concept is invoked by groups such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the Justice Policy Center, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Civil_Liberties_Union">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU). Here in Pennsylvania, <a href="http://decarceratepa.info/">DecarceratePA</a> and friends in Occupy Philly invoke this image especially in protest of Governor Corbett&rsquo;s budget priorities, arguing that state spending favors the prison system at the cost of public education.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of this pipeline imagery, it remains only a hypothesis. <a href="http://www.zerotolerancereform.com/wpblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Harvard-Civil-Rights-Project.pdf">Skiba et al. 2003</a> find some evidence that higher school suspension rates are correlated with higher juvenile incarceration rates, but the data is cross-sectional and limited in other ways that preclude confidence in a particular causal story. In a 2009 study, <a href="http://healthpolicy.unm.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Untangling%20the%20School%20Segment%20of%20The%20School-to-Prison%20Pipeline.pdf">Hood and Lopez</a> 2009 find that racial composition of school discipline is not related to the racial composition of juvenile incarceration. In any event, confidence in the argument seems far greater than current research allows, and at worst this could be an erroneous and merely rhetorical hook. Given that the American prison system is probably nothing short of our era&rsquo;s very own<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Crow-Michelle-Alexander/dp/1595586431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337506101&amp;sr=8-1"> Jim Crow</a> regime, the school-to-prison pipeline hypothesis is worth analyzing more scrupulously.</p>

<p><strong>2. A simple model: Is rising inequality &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; resources from education to incarceration?</strong></p>

<p>****The question of whether there is a school-to-prison pipeline begs the question of why there would be a school-to-prison pipeline. Lacking is a specifiable political explanation. One possible explanation is that<em> rising income inequality in the United States encourages policymakers to divert funding from education to incarceration</em>. Why? Classic political economy models of redistribution suggest that as income inequality increases, the median voter increasingly prefers higher taxation and public spending. Because elected policymakers aim to satisfy the pivotal median voter, redistribution should be positively associated with inequality. However, it&rsquo;s also well known that many factors often neutralize or reverse the link between inequality and redistribution. For instance, income inequality can enable the rich to simply capture the government. A combination of these two models can explain how there could be a systematic spending dynamic between education and incarceration. As income inequality increases and the rich gain political power relative to the poor, policymakers have much to gain from the rich, and little to lose from the poor, by cutting taxes and social spending. Although the poor face decreasing political power, we might expect that beyond some threshold, where the poor &ldquo;have nothing to lose but their chains,&rdquo; cuts to essential social services would indeed be severely punished&mdash;by, say, revolutionary upheaval. Therefore, as policymakers cut essential social spending, they should also alter the<em> composition</em> of social spending in a way that also pacifies a rising threat of rebellion.</p>

<p>In summary, perhaps rising income inequality (government capture by the rich and the political alienation of the poor) leads policymakers to divert spending from redistributive programs (public education) to programs of outright and coercive pacification (incarceration), not only further excluding the poor from political participation (the formal disenfranchisement of felons) but also literally, forcibly containing the threat of rebellion against the political system itself.</p>

<p><strong>3. Data</strong></p>

<p>****I&rsquo;ve collected time-series data from the United States for the past 60 years to examine whether there is, or has been, some sort of systematic relationship between education and  incarceration. Most of the data is culled from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/hist_stats.html">Census Bureau historical abstract</a> and usgovernmentspending.com. To extend the Census Bureau historical data past 2001 or so, I do some simple linear interpolations using more up-to-date Census Bureau time series (which go up to 2009 but extend back and overlap the early 2000s cutoff of the historical abstract). In any event, I&rsquo;ve uploaded all of the data to Google Fusion Tables for <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1TsYrSeGBV-mZSvJy0hRRHbUx4aEZoxrZgrymXTI">download</a> lest anyone wants to investigate further. The inequality variable is share of income going to the top 5% percent minus the share of income going to the bottom 5%; education spending per capita is total public spending per capita on elementary, secondary, and tertiary education; the incarceration variable is the number of people incarcerated per 1000 people (interpolated for some years with a slightly different measure, that of the total number under some form of supervision; this is a little awkward but it&rsquo;s a blog post, not a journal article, right?)  The final variables used here are found in the last few columns of the Google Fusion table.</p>

<p>The timespan analyzed here implies a much stronger version of the argument than is popularly articulated: evidence that a school-to-prison pipeline has not existed for several decades would not disprove many more limited versions of the argument. However, evidence of the harder-to-prove, stronger claim of a pipeline dynamic that holds across the past half-century would be even stronger support for today&rsquo;s more limited claims.</p>

<p><a href="">caption id=&ldquo;attachment_74&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;600&rdquo;</a><a href=""><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/school_prison_inequality2.jpg" alt="" /></a>(<a href="http://justinmurphy.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/67/school_prison_inequality-5/">http://justinmurphy.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/67/school_prison_inequality-5/</a>) The first graph illustrates the puzzle of increasing incarceration and decreasing crime. The second graph shows that inequality appears to track incarceration.<a href="">/caption</a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>The concept of a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; poses an interesting challenge for how we think about causality and statistical modeling. At a minimum, it seems to imply a negative relationship between two variables, an egress from a source and a flow into a sink, possibly driven by some third quantity representing the pressure or energy pumping the pipeline. There are certainly several ways one could approach modeling such pipeline between education and incarceration, but as a first cut, I test and find some evidence of relationships that together suggest the possibility of something that could reasonably be called a school-to-prison pipeline. The claims are followed by some fairly technical statistical output but with some non-technical notes for interpreting them.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Year-to-year increases in the incarceration rate are correlated with year-to-year decreases in education spending per capita</strong>, even after controlling for economic growth (GDP per capita) and any simple, secular trend over time. A common problem from modeling time-series data is that the variable one wants to explain is often so much a function of its previous years&#8217; values that it&rsquo;s easy to find spurious relationships with other explanatory variables. So all of the models below include a combination of lagged dependent variables or transformed variables (and pass traditional tests of significant serial correlation in the dependent variable).</li>
</ol>


<p>2. <strong>Year-to year increases in inequality are also correlated with year-to-year decreases in education spending per capita, a</strong><strong>lthough it is not clear if inequality itself correlates with decreases in education spending beyond its correlation with the incarceration rate. </strong>This is because when both inequality and incarceration rates are included in the same model (not displayed), Inequality drops out of statistical significance and Incarceration_Rate remains significant. It&rsquo;s possible that both have independent and separate negative effects on education spending but a full model can&rsquo;t sort out independent effects from two explanatory variables that are themselves highly correlated (high collinearity). Nonetheless, changes in the incarceration rate seem directly correlated with decreases in education spending. Inequality may or may not</p>

<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-56-29-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>If rising inequality is the pump of the pipeline, it would make sense that inequality itself is not directly, independently correlated with education spending. If increases in incarceration are associated with decreases in education, the model sketched above suggests rising inequality might very well explain most directly changes in the incarceration rate.  <strong>Inequality is positively associated with increased incarceration, controlling for the crime rate, previous incarceration rates, and secular trend. </strong>This is true whether or not one looks at levels or year-to-year changes. The interaction of crime and inequality (crime rate multiplied by inequality) also appears to have a systematic relationship to the incarceration rate, suggesting that neither inequality nor crime alone drive incarceration but that perhaps crime is a trigger for incarceration that is conditional on the degree of inequality&mdash;also consistent with the model sketched above.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-57-01-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Conservatives might claim that the notion of a school-to-prison pipeline is a misleading interpretation of the culture of poverty, in which the poor are thought to simply opt for crime over educational aspirations, requiring greater incarceration and less spending on education, which in turn leads the rich to get richer compared to an increasingly incarcerated poor. But there&rsquo;s no evidence for these claims: when all these variables are considered in one system of equations (vector autoregression or VAR), effectively allowing each to cause each controlling for the effects of the others, <strong>there remains evidence that inequality drives the incarceration rate and no evidence that crime or incarceration is driving inequality.</strong> It could be that crime and incarceration have an immediate effect on inequality or are highly collinear, and that either of these facts make its effect on inequality statistically indistinguishable&mdash;and for this reason it&rsquo;s no surprise the relationship between incarceration and education spending drops out&mdash;the key point of the table below is simply that inequality&rsquo;s effect on incarceration is robust against the conservative arguments to the effect that inequality is a fair outcome rather than a driver of unfair outcomes.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-57-24-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Below are overlaid impulse-response functions. The first graph displays the predicted effect that some exogenous shock on inequality has on education spending, compared to its effect on the incarceration rate. Moving from left to right across the x-axis charts the decay of the effect over time. Of course, this assumes that our VAR was a fully and correctly specified model, which is unlikely. Nonetheless, as a back of the e-napkin analysis, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that an exogenous shock to inequality has a positive and statistically significant effect on incarceration.</p>

<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/irf_inequality_education_prison.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second graph shows that an exogenous shock to inequality has a far larger effect on the incarceration rate than an exogenous shock to the crime rate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It suffices to point out for this first exposition of the model that reciprocity is an essential requirement of the relations among any and all sub-things which we will understand as composing an ensemble. However, the concept of reciprocity only represents the formal essence of another concept that has become at once a ubiquitious but diversely-employed and contested concept across the human sciences. What is here defined as reciprocity is the essential relationship that modern economics knows as <em>investment<strong>.</strong></em> If an investor invests in some new enterprise, the lender and borrower do not compose a durable ensemble of things unless the borrower earns enough money to at least pay the lender back. If the borrower doesn’t pay the lender back then there remains only a borrower and an insolvent, disappearing lender. </p>

<p>The connection to economics is only worth mentioning so early in the exposition because it will be highly significant later that one of the most simple relations between things is captured with such theoretical sophistication in modern economic theory. As Marx points out, for the sake of efficiency modern capitalism hardly hides its processes. Because it lays bare the motion of society so frankly, its laws become a wealth of insights into even pre-capitalist formations. Thus, none of this should be taken as implying “economic reductionism,” but rather quite the opposite. The modern economic conception of investment is only a very partial, ideological rendition of the basic—and much more parsimonious—pre-“economic” insight into a formal requirement of things in general, economic or otherwise. Namely, that for two things to endure as a system with only one supply of energy, any transfer of energy from one thing to the other must find a return route. Later in this work, it will become clear that <em>capitalism</em> is simply one historically specific but highly evolved and integrated organization of hierarchical institutions the essential characteristic of which is that it makes possible <em>infinite deferrals of true reciprocity</em> via ceaseless forms of leveraged investments.</p>

<p>Thus far, we have presupposed nothing concerning why, how, or when things plug into one another. The goal has been only to establish a parsimonious framework for theorizing the existence of things in a language that is at once deeply intuitive and draws credence from being at the intersection of several fields of knowledge. But why should we expect things to have plugged into one another in the ways that they have in the course of natural history? In other words, what does the framework developed here offer in the philosophically and/or scientifically rigorous study of the world?</p>

<p>We are now in a position to show that the framework developed here, almost childish in its return to the most basic premises because it synthesizes such basic lessons from diverse disciplines—enables a surprisingly simple yet potent set of deductions for explaining rather than just describing the nature of things.</p>

<p>At any point in time, what we call the <em>world</em> is only the sum of all things. A diagrammatic image of the world would depict so many things within variable ensembles. By pursuing implications already contained in our exposition so far, it is possible to understand how and why, historically, things have plugged into each other in certain ways. If physics, geometry, and electrical analysis are all so many partial angles on the essential nature of things, the modern theory of evolution is only one more.</p>

		<p>But where does the energy within a thing come from? Of course, in the human study of proximate causes, energy always comes from some other thing, a battery, for instance. It is well known that the search for original causes quickly encounters philosophical and historical conundrums that have never been satisfactorily overcome. Thus, as far as we know, all things derive their energy from something else, some sort of source or proximate cause. We will return to the question of origins later, but for the world of things that can be studied, every thing is in some way plugged into some other thing. Humans get their energy from food, food gets its energy from the sun, the sun was generated by larger cosmic forces, and it&rsquo;s simply not necessary to know where everything began to know that all things get their energy from some other thing. Depending on whether the perspective is from the giving or receiving thing, we will follow analysts of elecricity and name the point of connection between things <em>sink</em> or <em>source</em>, respectively. Once energy comes into a thing and supplies energy for its thinghood, electrical engineers teach us that any number of other things can be plugged into the first thing. If a new thing is plugged into a circuit, there are now simply two things composing one thing larger than the first thing by itself. </p>

<p>But to speak of “plugging” a new thing into the circuit of another thing, as a second lightbulb can be plugged into the circuit previously only running one lightbulb, is only a metaphor, already too specific and historically advanced to be justified as the exact model. It presupposes too much, for instance, that a thing can already exist before it&rsquo;s plugged into something else. A lightbulb is itself only produced by humans plugging hundreds of things into each other in a particular production process. So really what we need to understand are the conditions for the very possibility of plugging things into one another. In other words, how do things produce other things before it is possible to speak of “plugging?” </p>

<p>The study of natural systems suggests that things are constantly sending energy off of their own circuits, throwing it into the milieu of some other thing(s), sometimes dissipating, but sometimes powering some other thing. To pursue the intimations of our definitions, when a thing sends off energy out of its specific thinghood and thereby sends energy into some other thing(s) that channel it, stabilize, and circulate it in a new, more or less distinguishable configuration we might say that it simply <em>produces</em> a new thing. Because energy can be neither created nor destroyed, anytime a thing sends off energy, in a sense, it will be going somewhere, into some thing. So energy is inherently always producing, it is only a matter of what thing(s) it is producing. When a volcano erupts, the energy is seemingly more destructive than “productive,” but it is clear that the natural system of which it is a part reabsorb these energies and they function in its system. Thus, this is the circulation of energy within a certain ensemble of things, which we are capable of distinguishing into so many sub-things and sub-sub-things (the whole eco-system, the volcano, the magma, etc.) On the other hand, energies thrown out by one thing sometimes produce qualitatively new things, for instance, the production of organic matter from inorganic matter, or the engineered steering of steam into moving locomotives.</p>

<p>Thus, there are things and then there are things producing other things. Let us call <em>ensemble </em>any thing composed of more than one thing. This term emphasizes the open-endedness with which things can be composed of other things; there are no <em>a priori</em> reasons for defining in advance how many things can be plugged into how many things, and neither are there reasons for saying much about how things plug. It is enough just to establish that things plug into other things. Schematic of the simple, minimal ensemble:<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dflxCory1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The diagramatic representation of the ensemble focuses attention on an interesting feature of any existing ensemble. For an ensemble to persist, it would not be enough for a thing simply to send off energy somewhere. If a thing plugs into some other thing without the second thing plugging back into the first, without a plug in return, if the first thing diverts outside of itself previously-looping energy by a tangent, this implies the end of its own positive feedback. In such a situation, there would be no ensemble but rather a process of <em>transformation</em>. One thing would become a new thing, but that is all. Genuine transformation is genuine <em>creativity</em>, as we will see. The tangential offshoot of energy represented in the upper curved line of figure two illustrates that the new thing would receive all of the energy in the first thing; and as a result the first thing would simply lose its consistency as a thing. The second thing’s internal consistency or loop would absorb all of the first thing’s energy into its own loop if there were not a reciprocal tangential offshoot (the lower curved line) of energy back to the first thing. Thus, we say that for an ensemble to be a stable thing consisting of and constituted by sub-things, it is necessary for one sub-thing to plug into the second sub-thing and vice-versa. When two or more things each plug into one another, creating an ensemble, we say that their relationship is one of <em>reciprocity</em>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If we try to work from the most basic and uncontroversial terms, we might call by the name of <em>energy</em> (ἐνέργεια, “activity, operation”<strong>) t</strong>hat universal polymorphous lust that constitutes <em>things</em>. The universe is undeniably constituted and constituting, operating, and energy seems to be the best available term that accounts for it as a whole.</p>

<p>The term “energy” is not itself a thing or thing-in-itself (<em>noumenon</em>) because, according to classical physics, it is only indirectly observable, it exists only theoretically, abstractly deduced from observation. Because energy is also classically understood as a physical system&rsquo;s capacity to do work on another system, it seems much like the <em>line segment</em> in traditional Euclidean geometry. Like energy, the line is not a thing-in-itself, but a purely theoretical abstraction defined by Euclid as “breathless length.” A line segment is defined as a line bound by two endpoints, just as energy transfering between two systems similarly traverses a sort of breathless length from one point to another.</p>

<p>(Like all thinking that issues from a particular configuration of things rather than the theory of all things, these disciplines of knowledge are only partial angles in partial registers the partiality of which is specifically a function of the unquestioned <em>things</em> that are the condition for their theoretical development. This is to be explained later, but its mention in advance is perhaps necessary to assuage the anxiety of any institutionalized thought which, also a function of things rather than necessary truths, will be inclined to dismiss the present exposition as naïve or childish. Of course, it is both, but for good reasons.)</p>

<p>Energy within a system constitutes a <em>thing</em>. If there was no energy in a system, it would be <em>no-thing</em>. This is illustrated quite nicely by the philosophers of electricity, who argue that line means <em>circuit</em>, or in other words, a closed loop. Thus, we might reasonably define <strong>things</strong> as closed loops of variable energy. Diagrammatically, this implies a line segment that is curved rather than straight, and which loops back into itself.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m583wx9ZC51qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This definition of the thing presents a concise model of the most basic and distinguishing characteristic of thinghood, that a thing <em>is</em>, that it exists, that it sustains a certain circulation of energy in a more or less stable form for whatever period of time.</p>

		<p>The Ox just got a gnarly industrial-strength sewing machine so this week I decided to make my debut in fashion design.</p>

<p>Hat tip goes to <a href="http://rhls.com/about.html">Ruffeo Hearts Lil Snotty</a>, from whom I got the pattern <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGsQFjAA&amp;url=http://www.rhls.com/threadbanger/fannypack.pdf&amp;ei=iXnCT5KCFujG6AGeipSuCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyjzo-g5BE7flpB1rrY43PpfcfmA&amp;sig2=UJOrPRPgYAtdA_T6Q0gC4Q">here</a>. As a business their politics and aesthetics are not quite mine&mdash;ultimately they do seem to be selling the false freedoms of frivolity, nostalgia, and the possibility of an ethical life under contemporary capitalism&mdash;but as humans they seem pretty rad (anti-exploitation, &ldquo;anti-fashion&rdquo;, DIY, they closed down for May Day, etc.). Taking some liberties with the design and having neither a shred of experience nor skill in sewing, I feel like my version is sufficiently DIY-looking to at least signal a theoretical rejection of the status quo. Surveying my career as a fashion designer, I feel like my intention over the past six days or so has been to blend the prevailing hipster aesthetic with the, uh, &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; or something. I think by &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; I mean militant anticapitalist &ldquo;colors&rdquo; and &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; maybe.</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a fucking mess of goddam strings sticking out of every nook and crevice in the bloody thing but I feel like that is just my signature style as a fashion designer. Everything I make will just have a million goddamn strings sticking out of every bloody fold and cranny, not on purpose but because that&rsquo;s just my style or something, i.e. what happened this time and will probably keep happening because I feel no desire to learn how to avoid that happening. I can&rsquo;t believe sewing works considering it&rsquo;s just a million little idiotic strings going every which way. Of course that works, so obvious.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made of standard canvas from a bookbag, which I lined with vinyl to make it uh, possibly water resistant. Incidentally, the vinyl came from the Occupy Philly May Day &ldquo;STRIKE&rdquo; banner! It has belt loops in the back to string my belt through. I added a little D-ring, why? Fuck if I know!l Looks useful, why the fuck not? So easy, should have added a goddamn can opener while I was at it. I also threw in a few pencil holders, a little pouch on the inside, and a red square for the historically unprecedented, spontaneous, indefinite <em>manifestations</em> of hundreds of thousands of Québécois underway right now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start learning how to scrape/analyze data from the Twitter API. Starting with pretty simple stuff, I used the TwitteR package in R to scrape almost all of the tweets by both U.S.presidential nominees. It&rsquo;s only possible to download 3200 tweets at a time, but this accounts for most of Obama&rsquo;s tweets (4,016 at the time of writing this) and all of Romney&rsquo;s (953).</p>

<p>One question we can ask is whether either nominee tweets lengthier tweets than the other. We know that G.W. Bush cultivated a populist sort of anti-intellectual style of speaking, we think of McCain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Straight Talk Express&rdquo; bus tour, and of course Obama is often characterized as an academic elite.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rplot3.jpg"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rplot3.jpg?w=470" alt="Image" /></a></p>

<p>Interestingly, although the modal length of tweets for both candidates is around the maximum of 140, @MittRomney spikes a little bit around 50 characters. It&rsquo;s impossible to say from this little graphic whether this difference reveals something systematic, but maybe the spike of roughly 50-character tweets from @MittRomney reflects a more &ldquo;straight talking&rdquo; tweeter than @BarackObama?</p>
