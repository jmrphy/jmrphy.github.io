	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If we try to work from the most basic and uncontroversial terms, we might call by the name of <em>energy</em> (ἐνέργεια, “activity, operation”<strong>) t</strong>hat universal polymorphous lust that constitutes <em>things</em>. The universe is undeniably constituted and constituting, operating, and energy seems to be the best available term that accounts for it as a whole.</p>

<p>The term “energy” is not itself a thing or thing-in-itself (<em>noumenon</em>) because, according to classical physics, it is only indirectly observable, it exists only theoretically, abstractly deduced from observation. Because energy is also classically understood as a physical system&rsquo;s capacity to do work on another system, it seems much like the <em>line segment</em> in traditional Euclidean geometry. Like energy, the line is not a thing-in-itself, but a purely theoretical abstraction defined by Euclid as “breathless length.” A line segment is defined as a line bound by two endpoints, just as energy transfering between two systems similarly traverses a sort of breathless length from one point to another.</p>

<p>(Like all thinking that issues from a particular configuration of things rather than the theory of all things, these disciplines of knowledge are only partial angles in partial registers the partiality of which is specifically a function of the unquestioned <em>things</em> that are the condition for their theoretical development. This is to be explained later, but its mention in advance is perhaps necessary to assuage the anxiety of any institutionalized thought which, also a function of things rather than necessary truths, will be inclined to dismiss the present exposition as naïve or childish. Of course, it is both, but for good reasons.)</p>

<p>Energy within a system constitutes a <em>thing</em>. If there was no energy in a system, it would be <em>no-thing</em>. This is illustrated quite nicely by the philosophers of electricity, who argue that line means <em>circuit</em>, or in other words, a closed loop. Thus, we might reasonably define <strong>things</strong> as closed loops of variable energy. Diagrammatically, this implies a line segment that is curved rather than straight, and which loops back into itself.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m583wx9ZC51qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This definition of the thing presents a concise model of the most basic and distinguishing characteristic of thinghood, that a thing <em>is</em>, that it exists, that it sustains a certain circulation of energy in a more or less stable form for whatever period of time.</p>

		<p>The Ox just got a gnarly industrial-strength sewing machine so this week I decided to make my debut in fashion design.</p>

<p>Hat tip goes to <a href="http://rhls.com/about.html">Ruffeo Hearts Lil Snotty</a>, from whom I got the pattern <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGsQFjAA&amp;url=http://www.rhls.com/threadbanger/fannypack.pdf&amp;ei=iXnCT5KCFujG6AGeipSuCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyjzo-g5BE7flpB1rrY43PpfcfmA&amp;sig2=UJOrPRPgYAtdA_T6Q0gC4Q">here</a>. As a business their politics and aesthetics are not quite mine&mdash;ultimately they do seem to be selling the false freedoms of frivolity, nostalgia, and the possibility of an ethical life under contemporary capitalism&mdash;but as humans they seem pretty rad (anti-exploitation, &ldquo;anti-fashion&rdquo;, DIY, they closed down for May Day, etc.). Taking some liberties with the design and having neither a shred of experience nor skill in sewing, I feel like my version is sufficiently DIY-looking to at least signal a theoretical rejection of the status quo. Surveying my career as a fashion designer, I feel like my intention over the past six days or so has been to blend the prevailing hipster aesthetic with the, uh, &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; or something. I think by &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; I mean militant anticapitalist &ldquo;colors&rdquo; and &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; maybe.</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a fucking mess of goddam strings sticking out of every nook and crevice in the bloody thing but I feel like that is just my signature style as a fashion designer. Everything I make will just have a million goddamn strings sticking out of every bloody fold and cranny, not on purpose but because that&rsquo;s just my style or something, i.e. what happened this time and will probably keep happening because I feel no desire to learn how to avoid that happening. I can&rsquo;t believe sewing works considering it&rsquo;s just a million little idiotic strings going every which way. Of course that works, so obvious.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made of standard canvas from a bookbag, which I lined with vinyl to make it uh, possibly water resistant. Incidentally, the vinyl came from the Occupy Philly May Day &ldquo;STRIKE&rdquo; banner! It has belt loops in the back to string my belt through. I added a little D-ring, why? Fuck if I know!l Looks useful, why the fuck not? So easy, should have added a goddamn can opener while I was at it. I also threw in a few pencil holders, a little pouch on the inside, and a red square for the historically unprecedented, spontaneous, indefinite <em>manifestations</em> of hundreds of thousands of Québécois underway right now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start learning how to scrape/analyze data from the Twitter API. Starting with pretty simple stuff, I used the TwitteR package in R to scrape almost all of the tweets by both U.S.presidential nominees. It&rsquo;s only possible to download 3200 tweets at a time, but this accounts for most of Obama&rsquo;s tweets (4,016 at the time of writing this) and all of Romney&rsquo;s (953).</p>

<p>One question we can ask is whether either nominee tweets lengthier tweets than the other. We know that G.W. Bush cultivated a populist sort of anti-intellectual style of speaking, we think of McCain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Straight Talk Express&rdquo; bus tour, and of course Obama is often characterized as an academic elite.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rplot3.jpg"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rplot3.jpg?w=470" alt="Image" /></a></p>

<p>Interestingly, although the modal length of tweets for both candidates is around the maximum of 140, @MittRomney spikes a little bit around 50 characters. It&rsquo;s impossible to say from this little graphic whether this difference reveals something systematic, but maybe the spike of roughly 50-character tweets from @MittRomney reflects a more &ldquo;straight talking&rdquo; tweeter than @BarackObama?</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>1</p>

<p>I know a young woman of color who works at Whole Foods and she once told me there would never be a strike there. When I asked her why, she said it would never happen there because none of the workers would ever believe that it could actually be possible there.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>A middle-aged white man, a corrections officer at the local jail, is using sophisticated biometric technology to scan my hand from a thousand different angles, thanking us for doing what we’re doing, then telling his co-worker how he’d rather be at home with his kids, playing video games and “shooting shit.”</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>I enter a bar in a bourgeois part of town to visit my close friend who is bartending. I sit down, alone, and wait for my friend to notice me. To my right is a skinny, pale, dirty-blonde older man a little taller than myself but slouched, elbows on the bar. He says something to me, slurring, I forget what. One of the bartenders, not my friend, sets in front of the man a plate: steak, a small arugula salad, and french fries with some bullshit aoli or whatever the fuck. My friend is busy so the man and I get to talking. His name is Shawn and he works for a life insurance company.</p>

<p>“Great job,” he says, “It’s really fascinating, the way money works and living and dying and
everything work together, pretty crazy.”
“Yea, that is crazy,” I say, “You an Irish guy?”
“Yea,” he says, “you?”
“Yea,” I say.
“County Mayo, he says.
“Armagh,” I say. “Sometimes I think about moving there. It would probably feel authentic and self-righteous to live somewhere where I could feel like a legitimate member of the colonized rather than the colonizing.”</p>

<p>At that moment, the local news on the bar’s television ran a feature on the big protests that took place downtown earlier in the day. He could tell I had just come from downtown.</p>

<p>“Protesting never works, you need pipebombs, that’s what the Irish would do,” he informed me. He also offered me the rest of his food. Yes, of course, I’ll eat the rest of your food. I hate most Irish-Americans.
“I used to be like you, I am like you, I’m a marxist,” he informs me. He also bought me a beer.</p>

<p>“It’s never going to work, kid, I’m telling you. Just look at me…”
I just continue eating his scraps, take a sip of beer, and smile.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>“Look, you can’t change the world, you just can’t. Things have evolved how they’ve evolved for reasons, you can try to change things but you can’t change the reasons they are like they are so you can’t just stop the world from being like it is,” he said. He’s about eight years older than me, a goofy, friendly, funny white guy who likes comic books.</p>

<p>“No,” I told him, “Things are how they are because people like you make always make <em>that</em> argument. I don’t care if I’m naive or unrealistic, I have a right to be naive and unrealistic. And I actually believe its our obligation regardless of how practical it seems.”</p>

<p>“Wait until you’re my age, you’ll see… I used to think the same things you think. And people older than me used to tell me I would give it up eventually and back then I would insist that I was never going to give in…” He had tears in his eyes.
“And you did,” I said.
“And I did,” he said.
“Well you make your own choices and I respect that,” I said. But did you ever think that, at the very least, you owe it to us, to me and my generation and everyone else who hasn’t caved yet, to maybe atone for your own faithlessness, to at least refrain from deflating us? You are clearly disappointed in yourself and I would never rub salt in your wounds, as long as you don’t soothe your wounds by sapping our strength. We can change everything, if people like you would just shut the fuck up and give us even the most passive support rather than running your dead mouths. Have you ever considered the possibility that the only reason this awful world continues is because older people will say anything to forestall coming to terms with how they betrayed themselves?”</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h2>The neurotic repetitions in public opinion against Occupy</h2>

<p>Revolution is the radical demystification of desire beyond demand; conservatism is the mystification of desire by its reduction to demand.</p>

<p>Media spokespeople, critics on the right, and even sympathetic but timid bourgeois progressives everywhere will not cease clamoring, in so many obviously trembling equivalences: “Eventually, you’ll have to, sooner or later, focus, articulate demands, we understand your rage, but eventually, you’ll have to narrow the issues, what exactly do you want?” And so on and so forth. Of course, what is too frightening for most observers and the mainstream media to say aloud if they are even able to comprehend it is a certain realization that is increasingly obvious to many of us on the ground: that everyday more and more of us lose even the idea that we might ever again want something from the political system. Many of us, over the past few months, have simply lost the capacity to be delightfully charmed by the idea of anyone giving us anything.</p>

<p>Historically, the relative few in positions of power have had centuries to give the less powerful multitude what they want but, needless to say, those with power only ever concede the bare minimum required for the multitude to cooperate. The multitude has been asking for more since time immemorial, while every now and then some people get clever enough to try and take it, usually through centralized models such as building union power or skipping right to clandestine vanguards. Today, the arrogance and ignorance of the wealthy will be their downfall because now we’re just saying in all seriousness that the 99% should just take what they want, together and openly. And the reality is that when one has learned to take, asking becomes absurd. This logic is obvious enough, and its revolutionary significance explains the neurotic repetitions we hear over and over again. “Uh, eventually, sooner or later, you’ll need to make demands, uh&hellip; please,? please, please!” In fact, an expression such as “narrow down the issues” is a rather hilariously transparent euphemism, quite close to a good-old fashioned Freudian slip, for “please make your movement smaller and weaker.”</p>

<p>These neurotic repetitions from those who sit comfortably in the status quo not only serve to dissimulate and discredit the truth and reality of the revolutionary preference for taking over asking, a conversion of consciousness by which many of us on the ground are obviously being carried away. They are additionally symptomatic of a truly stunning repression of historical memory. Even many sympathetic progressive folks, if they sit comfortably in the status quo, will insist in all honesty that for strategic purposes we have to focus on specific demands. They are truly textbook neurotics insofar as their repetitions are symptoms of the repressed memory that the latest and greatest examples of the most powerfully revolutionary movements have been wildly unfocused, non-specific, and non-demanding. The first fact is that the only time we’ve approached genuine, democratic, non-authoritarian revolution in a postwar “liberal democracy” (France in 1968) has been through a social movement of unfocusing organization, proliferating rather than narrowing the issues, refusing to make demands, and the contagious occupation of physical spaces. The second fact is that this most genuine revolutionary surge of militant democracy was betrayed, defused, and thwarted precisely by a hierarchical reimposition of organizational focus by the unions and parties, a narrowing of issues, the making of demands, and exactly at the cost of, in a direct negotiated trade for, the end of occupations.</p>

<p>A theoretically and empirically rigorous analysis could show that these neurotic repetition compulsions against us, which we find across the board of bourgeois American opinion, are better interpreted as evidence that mass occupation and the refusal to make demands are indeed exactly the right approach. We must learn to interpret the pronouncements of status quo figures not as thermometers of contemporary feeling but as all the more convincing negative indicators of the true contemporary feeling, just as Freud interprets the neurotic who swears their dream is not about their mother…</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/01/31/16825969225/" itemprop="url">Art and bribery</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The history of art is a history of bribery. A young person who for many possible reasons was lucky enough to escape complete and total ideological subjugation in the first few years of life keeps in touch with their sense of desire, a desire for everything, a desire obscurely but undeniably not satisfied by the social organization of the life into which they have been thrown. Thus, they create, they permit themselves the curious project of ascertaining that part of everything to which they are not permitted access. For obvious reasons already elucidated, this ambition is always a fatal threat to the social system, wherever and whenever it appears. But a social system has always already evolved an almost infinite series of offers, one after another, for the individual to exchange the ambition for exiting or revolutionizing the whole system in return for some better individual offering within the system.</p>

<p>All life hitherto is the experience of being brought to a restaurant one never chose and given a menu that offers nothing especially desirable. But at this restaurant, when one decides one would rather leave and search for food elsewhere, the server begs you not to leave, promises the chef can arrange something for you, reads off one special dish after another, to be made just for you, each one a little more attractive than the last but never arriving at anything one genuinely wants to order, until he arrives at one that is just good enough for you to say, all right, you’ll take it. And the very few who politely listen to a thousand inadequate offerings before finally standing and walking toward the door? They find that the door was locked all along and, on the other side of it: a cop.</p>

<p>Interesting in this light is the practice of many restaurants to offer children crayons and paper to keep them pacified before their meal arrives.</p>

<p>So-called artists who go on to achieve successful bourgeois lives through profitable artistic work are akin to those who, after taking a look at the menu, make an announcement to leave, are met by the waiter and eventually settle on one of the very nice special dishes made “just for them,” but which, curiously, looks a lot like what the other artists are eating. Consider the <em>Salon des Refusés</em>, where the Impressionists famously took refuge. It was decreed by Napoleon. in 1863 by Napoleon. Why? Because no regime can tolerate painters of such talent breaking the rules and running around the dinner tables of the bourgeoisie; he had to give them a nice little room of their own in the corrupt and rotten regime despite which they were clearly going to keep working on their own. The true artist, the revolutionary artist, is the one who stands up, walks away, and meets his or her fate at the locked door guarded by police. When he or she gets there, such radical artists typically choose one of a few possible fates.</p>

<p>One choice is to kill oneself, an unfortunately common choice of some really great individuals. Another is to return to the table voluntarily and take something from the menu, also very common (rarely achieving fame, artists who enjoy bohemianism in their twenties in hopes of locking in middle-class security from their thirties onward).</p>

<p>A third choice is to go on hunger strike and wait until your either force-fed (your works are bought and sold by entreprenurial dealers you never even asked (Beuys, for instance, who consciously desired detachment from money but took as a <em>fait accompli</em> that his things were being bought and sold) or your dead corpse is taxidermied, polished up, and returned to the table you left (academic canonization, the exemplary case here being figures such as Nietzsche who die penniless, friendless, and delusional, completely rejected by society, only to become universally respected as an obvious genius. The popular idea of some people just being “ahead of one’s time” is an absurd ideological mystification for the simple and easily demonstrated process through which societies systematically identifies and banishes individuals precisely because they are “geniuses”, i.e. they refuse to be assimilated because they see their society better than it sees itself, but then reclaims and sterilizes their ideas which are at once too destructive of society and <em>too true</em> to be left lying around untouched.)</p>

<p>The final option is to stand up on one of the tables and suggest that everyone in the restaurant ignore the waiters, ignore the chefs, agree that the restaurant belongs to them, and proceed collectively to do whatever they all wish to do. This last option is the strategy characteristic of what is known as the avant-garde (a useful example for reasons to be elaborated below is the Situationist International and CoBrA, both of which insisted on just going into the kitchen and using what’s there to make new dishes, e.g. <em>detournement, </em>in order to subvert it according to theoretical, exploratory analyses of how the restaurant functions “normally”).</p>

<p>More urgent is the question about what is to be done given this castration faced by a critically rigorous artist or intellectual? The first is to become theoretically cognizant of its mechanisms, a work we have begun here. The second is to elucidate its implications, the first of which is the necessary, unconditional refusal by every genuine artist and intellectual to accept profit for anything he or she calls artistic or intellectual work. If one makes money from it, it’s simply not artistic or intellectual work. It’s a commodity, which is a betrayal of the inherent content of the genuine artistic impulse (revolutionary desire). Our analyses show that to profit monetarily from a production is the precise mechanism by which one volunteers to transform a potential freedom-source into a freedom-sink. Every manifestation of honesty in the history of the human intellect, as well as their consistent failures to achieve widespread and durable emancipation for anyone but a few passers of the torch in every generation, together represent an historical index of the capitalist transformation of freedom-sources into freedom-sinks.</p>

<p>The second is to form a community that is minimally but absolutely exclusive with respect to nothing other than this simple commitment, to develop one’s work as much as possible without implicating it in profit. The Situationists are an interesting example because they sensed very clearly the necessity of drawing sharp lines and rejecting those invested in the status quo, but they erred in their paranoiac politics that surrounded the line itself. For, it is not so much about the positive content of any works or ideas&mdash;it’s not even clear what content means anymore. Of chief importance today is the the relation works of art assume with the institutional status quo, the lines of the social circuitry with which it does or does not connect itself.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The difference between rich and poor is perhaps not as significant, operationally, as the difference between those whose work is relative to a particular space and those whose work is not relative to a particular space. This distinction is very close to the more popular distinction between material and immaterial labor, but clearly it is not exactly the same. The cleavage between spatial and non-spatial labor emerges in the realization that really it would be quite adequate if everyone could simply &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; everything according to the space of their labor. The final hour would consist in a voluntary, collective disavowal and disembodiment of any idea, norm, or habit that mediates the direct material and practical relationship of any individual and the spaces in which they do the labor of their daily lives.</p>

<p>The polemical, rhetorical distinction between the 99% and the 1% is—as everyone knows—only a loose approximation, but what exactly does it approximate? Perhaps it points toward the distinction between the overwhelming majority of those who <em>labor in space</em> and those who do not. The financiers at the New York Stock Exchange could go ahead and &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; their workspaces on Wall Street, and we should affirm their right to do so. The difference would be negligible because Wall Street effectively already owns us; whether the workers of Wall Street own the spaces of Wall Street would have little relative effect. But those who have no capital at all would obviously benefit the most by taking the space and material structures that are owned and controlled by others. Billionaires who own several mansions and private planes can keep them, and they can even feel free to “occupy” the boardrooms they already occupy. Let them have little communes for all we care, their orders will fall on deaf ears because we wouldn&rsquo;t have to tolerate anything but cooperation. When everything is occupied, all orders transmitted from one space to another, down the traditional hierarchies, will fall on deaf ears as those at the bottom have enough resources to choose mutual cooperation rather than obedience to orders.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2011/12/20/14513383241/" itemprop="url">On the bureaucratic superego and conventional constitution of siege by joint emancipated forces</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Over the past five hundred years, political repression has been slowly but steadily delegated to the individual. The <em>bureaucratic superego</em> is what I call the function by which the individual prohibits itself from doing things that in the past would have been the jurisdiction of the Law. The driving force for this transfer of functions has been the flexibility of movement desired and required by capital over the course of history. But here we recall and reformulate that essential Marxian insight concerning the tendency of capitalism to produce its own contradictions. Society’s evolutionary delegation of bureaucratic superegos to take over a task once performed by the Law has permitted and encouraged the Law to become lazy, complacent, or in other words, under-resourced, as the system over time distributed its energies away from everyday legal rigidity in favor of the flexible nomos required by the spinning of a market society from feudal threads.</p>

<p>Consider the university, which once upon a time was a physically guarded and socially sacred space that the uninitiated were literally prohibited from entering, let alone participating in. Over time, because of economic pressures such as the need for a greater quantity of educated workers—and for many other complex reasons, of course—the aristocratic gatekeepers were forced to open the gates as it were. They certainly didn’t want to. When they were forced to, powerholders only opened slowly, dragging their feet, but they also naturally liberalized in ways that maintained their gatekeeping authority. This is observable, for instance, in what we know call the “admissions process” but which is really more like a refusal or filtering process. Thus, today they still effectively prohibit entry by the lower classes beyond that which is absolutely required by economic pressures. That said, what needs to be stressed is how much, in the slow process of liberalizing the universities, the gatekeepers job was already delegated to the very undesirables themselves in the form of an obedient habitus hammered into shape by a long and bloody few centuries of early modern, capitalist subjectivation.</p>

<p>To come to the point, the successful evolution of reliable docility among the masses has enabled and encouraged institutions such as universities to become huge, sprawling, overpopulated, bureaucratically confused and chaotic social spaces. Almost all contemporary institutions smugly prioritize profitability to such an extreme degree that as far as legal exploration is concerned, it’s as if the owner of a jewelry store forgot to close its door one night and never came back. Colleges, for instance, are perfectly unguarded palaces of knowledge—any bum with a state ID can sit in the back of Intro to Zoology, look through some art books in the library, openly take some pens and paper from the History Department’s mail room, and launch a more intelligent and revolutionary research program than most enrolled students. All for free, all quite legally and rather without hassle, too!</p>

<p>Now, of course, very few people excluded from higher education take or occupy the education that is laughably available to them at no monetary, legal, or bureaucratic expense, but they fail to do so chiefly because of the variegated historical tendencies that culminate in the production of what I’m here calling the bureaucratic superego. In other words, capitalism over hundreds of years policed the masses into obedience so effectively that it now essentially trusts them to police themselves. It is astounding, that a whole system whose essential characteristic is dishonor (recall that a contract society is by definition a society lacking honor), relies for its very existence on what is essentially an honor system that only applies to the most disadvantaged.</p>

<p>The imperative for the revolutionary avant-garde is simple and obvious.</p>

<p>There exists a space marked out between our habits of everyday life and the actual existence of state power: to the side of the police line held by our bureaucratic superegos are all of our everyday, routine thoughts and behaviors, and across a finite space are the seats of power legally enforced by state police and ultimately the military. Within this space, a space with finite width but infinite depth, are all of the imaginable behaviors over which complacent institutions have no control but which we currently fail to perform because we are thoroughly dominated by bureaucratic superegos, the police function evolutionarily delegated to human subjectivity over the past five hundred years. <strong>Beginning now with the arrival of its theoretical comprehension, this space should now be conceived as formally liberated territory to be occupied immediately by all members of the entire international revolutionary avant-garde.</strong></p>

<p>It is worth noting, for example, how this present piece of writing, itself occupying the very space the formal liberation of which it is inaugurating for the whole international avant-garde, is essentially the first of its kind in the history of humanity insofar as it is able peacefully and legally announce and call for a real, concrete global revolution that would literally and effectively replace every currently existing government instantly. Because of their bureaucratic superegos which teach them to distrust and dismiss any first glimpses of human freedom, this document will appear to most bourgeois artists and scientists as delusional ravings with a child’s fingerpainting attached, and of course it is, but by a child Hegelian enough to realize it’s nonetheless the most authentic artistic, scientific, and political achievement ever accomplished by a young man inhabiting the unpoliced terrain of his society’s most advanced intellectual, aesthetic, and technological capabilities. What will appear first as apparently delusional ravings will, precisely in its unapologetic freedom and through a dialectic I will now proceed to elaborate, irresistbly inspire others around the globe to occupy this same infinite space of unpoliced possibilities.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we may also observe here an implication of the highest significance. Let us for convenience name “avant-garde” the revolutionary tendency in art and “vanguard” the equivalent in politics, as the etymology obviously suggests. Then, each tendency can be conceptualized as parallel phalanxes converging on the same open enemy territory. The politicized occupations of legally unpoliced space (as in the U.S. occupation sights before the evictions) as well as entrances into open buildings for the purpose of protest is known as “direct action.” Direct action, although converging on state power, does not intend the forcible occupation of the seat of state power itself,what the revolutionary tradition shortsightedly called “taking power.” This is perhaps because history has shown over the past century that the forcible occupation of the seats of state power is not truly “taking power,” but rather its opposite, namely, being “taken by power.” This, of course, has been the fate of all authoritarian socialisms or communisms. It is now possible, however, to see that truly taking power without being taken by power would be for the revolutionary phalanxes of art and politics to both converge on the enemy territory via the unpoliced fronts of everyday life.</p>

<p>Diagrammtically, the revolutionary phalanxes must be conceived as starting at one point but widening as they move forward toward state power. The simple reason why the avant-garde as well as the vanguard have been critical concepts in both traditions is not because there need to be leaders, as in the disastrously erroneous doctrine of Leninism. The limited quantity of representatives in any emergent avant-garde or vanguard is simply a function of the evolutionary fact that everything has to start somewhere, with some minor perturbation in the system. And it is no criticism of the individuals first possessed of the revolutionary perturbations that they are merely “privileged” or “bourgeois” as if that disqualifies them. It is conservative bourgeois ideology to critique revolutionaries for being bourgeois, for not only is it a patently <em>ad hominem</em> argument, it’s effect is simply to use the force of an arbitrary idea to disqualify the only wing of the proletariat who have the resources (time, education, technology, etc), in other words, who have the privilege of revolutionary consciousness and activity. It is no criticism because if they are truly revolutionary, their only function is to spread freedom through contagion, to embody a freedom whose specific nature and function is to proliferate and multiply itself through <a href="http://Justin%20Murphyields.tumblr.com/post/14482890002/the-occupations-hipsterdom-and-the-resexualization-of">a process I’ve modeled in a previous section with respect to the political vanguard</a> and according to which the avant-garde will expand just as well. In any event, we should conceptualized both revolutionary wings as widening and converging phalanxes as in the diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwhskqVGyw1qz9517.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Understood this way, we gain a picture of revolutionary strategy that is a rediscovery of the traditional military tactic known as siege. It implies a theory of siege updated for an era in which the notions of guerilla warfare or armed struggle are nothing short of nostalgiac fantasies literally bought and sold peacefully, opiates dished out to the rebelliously-minded. But neither are we offering here a merely mental consumption good for postmodern theorists. This is an immediate call to action, and in fact represents yet another rediscovery of an archetypal political tradition stood on its feet in an era standing on its head. I am hereby declaring what is essentially a constitutional convention for the revolutionary avant-garde—a congregation in which all interested parties come together for the purpose of demolishing a particular political organization in favor of constituting a new one. However, for the revolutionary avant-garde today, the traditional order of terms must be reversed if the concept is to be truthful. Everywhere one borrows the equations of bourgeois political ideology, they must be turned back on their feet.</p>

<p>It is thus that we should hereby announce our <em>conventional constitution</em> rather than a constitutional convention. The constitutional convention traditionally functions as a sort of engine that is supposed to power a new political society according to variable tempos and rythms with, for instance, the American “separation of powers” functioning as a literal throttle of democratic desire. But the whole charade involves nothing more than instituting or constituting conventions, intended for the behavior and language of others to converge on (as per the philosophical tradition known as conventionalism). The bourgeois ideological formula offers the public the fantastic idea that a society is convening in order to produce a constitution that will govern it, whereas all that happens is a few of the most powerful individuals constitute conventions to be imposed by legal force on a subject population.</p>

<p>Today, where the revolutionary avant-garde in the artistic sphere meets the revolutionary political vanguard in the contemporary global movement to occupy everything, including every last cobwebbed corner of conceptual space, at that precise point of intersection we <em>lay siege</em> to all currently existing bourgeois governments by creatively performing the truth they dissimulate. By truthfully pronouncing in absolute seriousness the current formation of a revolutionary united front through conventional consitution as literally the only legitimate government of the entire globe, we effectively and realistically lay siege to all bourgeois governments currently existing insofar as we literally do exactly what they did, but for the first time in world history we do it transparently and honestly. In this way, doing exactly what they did, but for the first time in human history doing it from the bottom up in an international mass movement, we will literally have them surrounded. And the reason I cannot stress enough that this is truly a real siege and not merely “symbolic,” and that this would truly be sufficient for real, concrete political revolution, is that the siege truly cuts state power off from one of its essential, vital functions, the bureaucratic superegos of its self-policed subjects. The conventional consitution of the revolutionary united front effectively does this because the bureaucratic superego quickly defects when the ego is exposed to contact with true human freedom, which, to put forward a provisional definition, might be something like the consciousness of the nonexistence of restraints.</p>

<p>To better specifiy the real and concrete effectivity of the revolutionary avant-garde in occupying the unpoliced yet unexplored space of contemporary life, the operative causal mechanism is to give the public irresistible performances of true human freedom to which they’re bureaucratic superegos are fatally allergic. The logic of political direct action aims for the same achievement on the political plane. There, activists demonstrate, not least by dramatizing their absurd defecit of power and thus a certain charming and inspiring impossibility or martyrdom called civil disobedience, the fantastic notion that anyone can fight the system. It operates according to a dialectically self-fulfilling prophecy. Their performance is artistic (deceptive) because to truly fight the system would in fact require the participation of everyone in society, but their performance makes it possible for others to believe that anyone can fight the system, thus producing a tendency toward the conditions for which anyone could fight the system (in the sense of being part of everyone fighting the system). And thus we come to understand how the revolutionary avant-garde converges dialectically with the revolutionary vanguard.</p>

<p>In their true forms, the revolutionary artist is a political revolutionary (constituting the first and only legitimate global government in the history of humankind) while the political revolutionary is a revolutionary artist (performing the most beautiful act in the history of humankind, that of the individual who can defeat a whole social system).</p>

<p>I simply cannot stress enough how the theoretical strategy elucidated here cannot be dismissed with the old reality versus theory criticism (which Marx himself helped popularize with respect to interlocutors such as Proudhon) that would say this is giving to the conceptual sphere a pracitical effectivity that is simply delusional. I have elaborated concrete causal mechanisms by which conceptual activity has effects on the level of practical behavior and political developments. These could potentially be wrong, but they require analysis and argumentation from anyone who will claim this is merely highfalutin theory.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In the study of international relations, there is a conventional and well-demonstrated theory according to which 1.) global stability is to be understood as a “public good,” and 2.) that due to strategic problems obstructing collective cooperation, often a hegemon is required to effectively subsidize it (Krasner 1976; Kindleberger 1981). Put very simply, in the absence of a hegemon, the global system tends toward conflict in a &ldquo;race to the bottom.&rdquo; Many states with more or less equal power and acting in their own self-interest calculate that, for instance, raising tariffs will help their domestic industries. However, the outcome is that as every other state acts similarly, all countries fare worse than they would have had they not raised tariffs. A global hegemon can prevent this bad equilibrium by effectively enforcing global free trade. More specifically, it is commonly argued that these conditions characterized the global system immediately after World War II, with the United States subsidizing the construction of an “embedded liberalism” (Ruggie 1983) and using “strategic restraint” (Ikenberry 2001) to favor global free trade rather than traditional militaristic domination.</p>

<p>We can develop and further specifiy this line of thought by elaborating how one of the “public goods” subsidized by liberal American hegemony was perhaps the maintenance of a certain ideological hygiene for the postwar capitalist order. One could argue that U.S. culture industry, nurtured by a media market that exemplifies the liberal, commercial model of state-media relations as well as a liberal bourgeois public opinion, has functioned as a sort of protective filter in global media circulation, a vacuum drain that shoots into the dumpster of forgotten history any ugly flotsam that rises up from the placid sea of global capitalist ideology. </p>

<p>This filter for the global desiring machine performs the specific and essential function of making any threat to the system replaced by whatever U.S. media puts in its place. The US media, in this model, is a sort of condom for catching the ejaculant of global capitalism, preventing the excesses of capitalist desire from fertilizing offspring that will ultimately contest the father.</p>

<p>More recently, variation across the covers of Time Magazine’s different regional editions provide stunning evidence for this claim. Below are the various regional editions of Time Magazine for the weeks of October 24th and December 5th of this writing (2011).</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwhb4v7QFj1qz9517.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwhb0p8eU01qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whereas the rest of the world sees a proud Egyptian revolutionary in a gas mask, readers in the United States see a story not just about anxiety, but why it&rsquo;s &ldquo;good for you.&rdquo; These images, only suggestive from a social scientific perspective, provide almost too-provocative evidence of the hypothesis advanced in the last section, that differences in U.S. news reportage perform a certain function of ideological filtering for global flows of desire. </p>

<p> Although we remain for the moment agnostic with respect to the specific characteristics of the U.S. media that lead it to function as global ideological filter, the hypothesis along with the patently conservative biases exemplified in these magazine covers would be consistent with the dyanmic patterns of variation <a href="http://Justin%20Murphyields.tumblr.com/post/14483036324/a-return-of-the-repressed-preliminary-theory-and">uncovered previously using data from Google Books</a>. Material political or economic shocks to the system (radical rebellions such as that of May 1968 in France or the Egyptian uprising this past year) enters into regional or global news but is prevented from causing truly global disruptions of consciousness by a domestic U.S. media quickly replacing it with the sterile human interest stories for which it is famous. Because the U.S. is one of the chief exporters of culture in the world, this sterilization of news consumption for even just the U.S. domestic market represents an <em>energy sink</em> for the whole global system. If revolutionary energy doesn’t get in, it obviously doesn’t get sent back out, and this is especially significant because so much of global culture is set by the American culture industries.</p>
