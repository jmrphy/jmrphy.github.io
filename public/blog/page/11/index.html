	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Suzanne Goldenberg of the <em>Guardian</em> reports a graph, apparently by <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/spais/people/person/148552">Matthew Hope</a> of the University of Bristol, to illustrate the claim that Obama is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">less interested in climate change than Bush</a>. This comes on the heels of several critics who point out that Obama did not mention climate change once in his past State of the Union address. The graph displays aggregate mentions of &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environnment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfutfsoliB1qz9517.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>However, as Ben Jervey of <em>Good</em> points out, Goldenberg&rsquo;s inference from her analysis <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">is wrong</a>. As Jervey suggests, Obama&rsquo;s lack of interest in &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; is due simply to a shift in rhetorical strategy, as Obama has chosen to frame the problems of climate change as an issue of &ldquo;clean energy.&rdquo; An analysis similar to Goldenberg&rsquo;s provides some compelling evidence for the latter view. Below, I&rsquo;m posting a graph comparable to Goldenberg&rsquo;s but with mentions of &ldquo;energy&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo; As graphics should, this largely speaks for itself:<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfuudeGs1v1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2010/09/19/abigail/" itemprop="url">Abigail asks a question</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A story for children</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>It was early in the morning and Abigail was preparing for her very first day of school when she stopped for a moment and looked up at her mother nervously. Abigail asked a question. To her it seemed very simple. “Why do I have to go school?” Abigail did not really want to stay home. She just wanted to know why she had to go to school. Her mother, busy as mothers sometimes are, did not seem to take her question too seriously. Our Abigail, on the other hand, was a perfectly serious little thinker, but since she did not want to distract or bother her good mother, she decided not to push too hard with tough questions. Abigail had a knack for difficult questions.</p>

<p>Abigail went through her first four classes with happy amazement! School was so weird to her! She could not understand why she was not allowed to eat snacks during class or why the teachers put so many different things on the walls! She thought it was so silly that she had to ask permission just to go to the bathroom! Abigail thought it was funny and interesting, so she went through her first four classes with her eyes wide open, trying her hardest to understand the place! Even the outside of the school—the playing fields and all the grass—had a fence around it with locks and security guards, so that even the outside was inside the school. It really was an odd place. Abigail kept wondering why she had to be there.</p>

<p>After the first four classes, Abigail got to go outside and play with the other kids. While all the other kids were just happy to be outside, Abigail walked around asking everyone her question. Many of her classmates did not understand why she was asking the question. Some of the other kids thought she was making a funny joke. Some of the other kids thought it was a good question and they wanted to know the answer, too! Still some other kids thought her question was stupid and annoying and told her to go away! She even thought the teachers were watching her as if she was up to trouble, even though she was behaving very well!</p>

<p>Abigail could not understand why this question would receive such different responses but no good answer! Abigail really wanted to know. She decided that she was going to ask all of her teachers for the rest of the day until she got an answer! Three subjects left gave her three chances before she went home that day. When she told the other students this, then the students found something they could all agree on. Abigail might ask some of the teachers but she would never even think about asking the math teacher! Everyone knew the math teacher was the meanest and that Abigail would keep her mouth shut for math class.</p>

<h3>Period Five, English, Miss Benna Benign</h3>

<p>In period five, the teacher was very nice and she very kindly told all the students that they could ask any questions at any time. Immediately, Abigail asked, “Why do we all have to come to school?” The teacher was nice so she smiled and said, “It’s for your own good! So you learn everything you need to know!” But our Abigail was a smart girl. She knew this was not the true answer, because Miss Benign’s answer did not tell Abigail what Abigail needed to know!</p>

<h3>Period Six, Social Studies, Mr. Patrick Priggish, PhD</h3>

<p>Social studies, during period six, was taught by a very smart teacher, so Abigail was sure she would get a good answer from him. A few minutes into class, Abigail raised her hand and asked, “Why do we all have to come to school?” And Mr. Priggish was so smart that by the time he was done saying a whole bunch of really smart things, Abigail could tell he forgot about her question! “Well, Abigail,” he began,  “schools have been around for thousands of years&hellip;a lot of different purposes&hellip;many kinds of schools…SOCIALLY INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT…” That was it! Mr. Priggish was lost in his own thoughts, Abigail could tell. Some of the other students thought they were the ones who got lost, but our Abigail was a good learner and she was starting to understand how these teachers work!</p>

<h3>Period Seven, Math, Mrs. Danielle Disdainful-Derisive</h3>

<p>When period seven began, Abigail could tell that Mrs. Disdainful-Derisive really was mean! But Abigail did not worry. She knew that if she behaved herself, and did not break any rules, she would be just fine. A few minutes into the class, a few of the other students were shocked when Abigail raised her hand. When Abigail was called on, she asked very calmly, “Why do we all have to come to school?” Abigail heard some of the students chuckle and she saw some of them look away in fear for her! The teacher made a funny face because she did not know what to say, and because she did not know what to say, she got angry! “Your question has nothing to do with math! It is irrefutably irrelevant…outrageously off-topic…ca…ca…ca…cantankerously counterproductive! Go to the principal’s office right now!”</p>

<p>Abigail could not believe it. What did she do? Oh, she was so confused! She wanted to go home and never come back. What were her parents going to say?</p>

<h3>Principal Grayhair Garfunkel</h3>

<p>When Abigail entered the principal’s office, she was surprised to see a very old man with a very gentle appearance.</p>

<p>“Abigail, were you keeping Mrs. Disdainful-Derisive from conducting her lesson?”</p>

<p>“No, well, I thought my question was part of the lesson!”</p>

<p>“She said you asked a question that had nothing to do with the lesson, that you were trying to be a smart alec, just to tease her and to distract the other students.”</p>

<p>“No! I just wanted to know the answer!”</p>

<p>“What was the question, Abigail?”</p>

<p>“Why do we have to come to school?” She looked a little nervous and embarrassed to ask her question yet again after all the trouble she caused.</p>

<p>Mr. Garfunkel saw that she was a good girl and that she was very nervous, and he responded kindly, “Ah, relax, Abigail. You know, we have heard this question before. Truthfully, it is not a bad question. Do you want me to tell you the answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, Abigail, you should be proud that you came upon this question at such a young age and that you had the courage to ask it. Most students never even think about it, and then most who do think of it would rather not ask it. I went to this school when I was your age, and I remember asking that same question! Nobody gave me a good answer and I was sent to the principal, too! And do you want to hear the funniest thing? Now, I AM the principal and have been for 30 years now, and I still have not learned a good answer to that question! And I’m the principal!</p>

<p>Listen, Abigail. Everyone just wants to go through their life and be happy in their own ways. Different people do this differently, and they invent different things to do different things. As you get older you will learn a lot about how people and things work, and I bet you already have today. There are always people who are bigger than you, and older than you, and smarter than you, and sometimes they force you to do things with no good answers for your questions! But if you keep your eyes open and trust your own ideas and questions, you’ll learn how people and things work. Do you know what happens next? Before you learn any of the answers, YOU are the principal and kids ask YOU why they have to come to school. You won’t KNOW the answer, but you’ll be free to respond however you think is best.”</p>

<p>Abigail, being a perfectly serious little thinker, started wondering how she would respond if someone asked her.</p>

<p>“You can go back to class now, Abigail.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Garfunkel,” Abigail said, gratefully, turning toward the door.</p>

<p>But before she made it through the door, Mr. Garfunkel called her name. She turned back around.</p>

<p>“Abigail, did I answer your question?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Mr. Garfunkel, I think so,” Abigail said, not perfectly certain but feeling much better about everything.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Sure, Benjamin used hashish and mescaline; the hippies used pot, acid, and any number of other drugs. There are many examples of visionaries who used drugs. But today we have neither the erudition and discipline of a Benjamin, nor the capacity for love which the hippies still had. All we have is increasing atomism and incessant economic dislocations and disruptions. Contemporary recreational drugs, consequently, are misunderstood. Recreational drugs are still often seen as on the side of social change, a vague protest vote, from the critical and liberal-minded individuals opposed to outdated and provincial conservatives.</p>

<p>But the truth is that drugs do not transport one from a square and normal world to a place more fluid and free: the status quo is such an historical aberration, such an abnormal and inhuman disequilibrium, that recreational drug use typically quenches the <em>conservative</em> thirst to slow down incessant and unsettling change, to create an oasis of stability where the world might have a moment to make sense to itself.</p>

<p>Thus, it is an absurd ideological inversion only a capitalist society is capable of, that recreational drug cultures see themselves as on the side of change and their lawmakers&mdash;who in fact preside over daily planetary dislocations&mdash;as lacking flexibility.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2009/07/18/streetcar/" itemprop="url">In a streetcar in New Orleans</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>1</p>

<p>A sadly underreported fact about the famous streetcar named desire is that when it stops to reverse direction at Poydras and St. Peters streets, the driver of the Sunday evening shift leaves the streetcar with its power off and doors open for twenty minutes, twice. Once before he turns it around, and once after he turns it around, he enters the casino for a “bathroom break.” One function of the break is to release an ambiguous distribution of flows that has built up over the course of the shift, but its second function is to create the effect that the streetcar turns around. For, the streetcar named desire never turns around. Rather, it only moves forward and backward, and even this is disputable given the stupidity of such a distinction in the present case. In a transfixing basin of the most vulgar flows and breaks, a lowly circuitry connects a classic American waterway to voodoo-electric rails, which plug Yankee Doodle dandies into the raw and base truth of what is called, I think, sometimes ironically, true love.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>I was born somewhere in the northeast of the United States in 1986 as the bastard brat of an Irish peddler. Pursuing a profession that does not permit regular exercise of my formerly youthful literary talents, I trust the reader will excuse any minor error or awkwardness in my prose. I write to you, the public, not on account of any particular stylistic ability I possess (although I do believe I possess such ability, as is evident in my prose) but because I have experienced something unique and of a general human interest, because I alone have seen and heard exceptional things and can formulate a small story that, I believe, amounts to a whole greater than the sum of its parts and is truly profound and of the utmost urgency to my peers.</p>

<p>I will skip several interesting details of my life and begin with the year 2004 when my first and current serious girlfriend first obtained me. She was beautiful, the best, I daresay. My parents never divorced but despite this, or because of it, I have always held the strictest conviction that romantic relationships should imply absolute erotic fidelity. Everyone cheats: celebrity cell-phone penis and crying family-men on my computer and television, respectively. But I would not and do not cheat, on anything or anyone. Although I am modern and emancipated, I am classically educated in the western, Christian tradition and I, for one, have a taste for the pathos of ascetic self-abnegation. How else is one to live a life of any depth and gravitas if not through a certain accumulation of resources, a continually unreleased pregnancy of energy?</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Then one night in New Orleans, Louisiana, there on business, I met an interesting woman a few years older than myself. When I first met her she told me a curious fact: when a novice hunter first shoots a rifle at big game, it often happens that he misses his shot but also gets an erection, as if through some cosmic inter-specie compensation. Standing under one of those very southern, very slave-owning-like New Orleans second-story balconies that line the streets of the French Quarter, I was surprised by this statement. She did not look the hunting type: her pale and mean visage of disaffection was of the liberal-urban variety, a disaffection similar in origin but distinct in manifestation to the back-to-basics, neo-luddite, hunting kind. But when a beautiful stranger tells you something questionable in a contemporary American city underneath slave-owning-like balconies, you believe it because you like it, and then you like it even more, so much that you then simply and truly believe it without qualification. In any event, we did some drinking and a lot of walking around in circles; we walked a short stretch of the Mississippi, silently waiting for something profoundly American to happen; having little money and less desire to spend any, we walked into the Harrah’s casino for some free oxygen, the purest oxygen available in the middle of a New Orleans evening, oxygen pure enough to wake the dead and which, in fact, serves no other purpose than precisely to keep the dead awake.</p>

<p>It was when we walked out of the casino that we saw the driver of the streetcar named desire pretending to turn it around.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>“How long until it starts up again?” I asked the man.</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes,” he said.</p>

<p>Both of us needed to go uptown eventually, but neither of us would have objected to riding the streetcar in whatever direction it might have been going. It was cold outside and since, despite the doors being open, the streetcar retained some of its interior heating, we naturally went inside and took our seats. I cannot speak for the lady but, of course, I made some mental calculations and conjured up a montage of film scenes in which someone other than I makes a very efficient use of twenty minutes within a dark, warm New Orleans streetcar. This musing itself being pleasant enough, and my being in a serious romantic relationship of absolute fidelity to another woman not present, combined to result in what I deemed at the time to be an outstandingly honorable self-restraint. First, as I said before, I do not cheat on anything or anyone. Second, who knew if anyone else might board the streetcar or if the man would return in less than twenty minutes? Nonetheless, I grappled with the possibility that my so-called restraint was in fact simply a tragic impotence to assume heroically such a rare and mythically-saturated inflection of my own destiny.</p>

<p>Eventually, after nobody else boarded the streetcar and the man came back exactly twenty minutes later, he turned on the streetcar, moved it one hundred feet westward, and then turned it off again. He exited the streetcar saying to us, once again, “I’ll be back in twenty minutes.” As I sat with the lady once again in a dark, empty New Orleans streetcar, by this time the indicators of our joint destinies had become so palpably insistent and demonstrative that this second chance defeated itself in the obviousness of its divine generosity.</p>

<p>“Thank you, God,” I thought to myself, “I get it, but now you have insulted me.”</p>
