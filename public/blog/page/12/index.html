	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Traditional Freudian psychoanalysis, of course, posits the unconscious as the inherently inaccessible mental bedrock of conscious mental activity. It is, as the basic argument goes, the chaotic, non-logical, all-desiring source of mental energy—demanding at once the absolute proliferation of vitality and the absolute rest of death—the mad little homonculous which is controlled by the psychological machinery of conscioussness: repression, sublimation, projection, etc. With the insights of modern linguistics and especially the vocabulary of structuralism at his disposal, the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan was able to come right out and say that the unconscious is structured like a language.</p>

<p>That language, the way we talk and what we understand as sensible for speaking, represents a certain rationality, and thus a certain kind of morality. If you can’t say certain things because they don’t make sense given our current state of words and rules for words, then you can’t or are discouraged from doing things that correspond to such impossible sayings.</p>

<p>Algorithms of articifical intelligence have an inherently political dimension and at their frontier this dimension represents a precarious pivot between death and life, i.e. conservation and revolution. On the one hand, they interpret new information based on what they know about the past, and there is thus a rational tendency—founded on the very true, real inertia of real history—to assume that the new is like the old and to thus to impose old formulas on novel articulations. Thus, one component of the political unconscious revealed by Google’s speech-to-text algorithm will be the following: it will reveal at points the conservative obverse of linguistic novelties, how exactly the inert speech of the status quo is mathematically most likely to impose the weight of dead customary formulae onto even the most radical, innovative articulations. Thus, on one hand, Google’s transcription service is a kind of molecular linguistic Thermidor machine, mathematically reducing freedom of linguistic invention to that which is most common and dead</p>

<p>On the other hand, because of practical imperfections and simple technological inadequacies—errors induced by background noise, irregularities in human speech (speaking too fast or eliding syllables, slurs, stutters, etc.), differences in dialect, the algorithm’s inability to deal with any languages other than English despite penetration of English by many foreign tongues, etc.) misfired transcriptions of common, dead, bourgeois formulae will become accidental slips of the most profoundly revolutionary social imagination, as in dreams, the delirious ravings of schizophrenics, and so-called “Freudian slips.” Why do we claim that such erroneous transcriptions will have a profoundly revolutionary content? It is because, as errors, they will be outside the limits proscribed by status-quo reason, but by virtue of the best effort of the algorithm, they will be the best errors, the nonsensical, prohibited-by-reason errors which are nonetheless the very closest to reason itself: the errors contained within reasonable language.</p>

<p>One can invent, sui generis, radically innovative theories or images but these tend to be utopian, disconnected from the imminent logic of history and in fact such utopianism is usually a function of socially and politically manipulated fantasies if not designed then at least permitted and encouraged by the dominant powers, as when corporate advertising pitches us so many varieties of freedom only to make us work harder and spend more, to submit more, in order to obtain them. The most radically dangerous and truly revolutionary historical ruptures are those that are already imminently contained in the weighty, inescapable, all-pervasive, strictures of reasonable reality itself. Thus, when common expressions are transcribed erroneously the result represents a floating to the conscious top of the most saliently precarious links in the chain of signifiers that represents the symbolic order of reason, that status-quo itself. Not only can we rightfully deduce that such points of slippage are the most salient and precarious (precarious because prone to imminent reversal or subversion, salient because precarious) but the positive content the transcription assigns to such slipping links is by definition the socially and historically weightiest possible alternative, in other words the most practically realizable. Thus, the practical conclusion of this consideration is to be particularly keen with respect to politically inflected errors in the transcription of common expressions. The mathematics of artifical intelligence and natural-language learning suggest that such errors not only announce themselves as so many heels of Achilles in the rational defense of the established order but also reveal, scientifically, the most imminently practical line of flight.</p>

<p>The following poem was produced by reading a passage of Deleuze and Guattari&rsquo;s <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> into Google&rsquo;s transcription service. The errors and slippages are surprisingly coherent and suggestive, distinct and decisvely different than the original text, but connected to it by a cipher which is certainly not random.<br/>
When you can, Johnson,<br/>
Again.<br/>
Friends and family,<br/>
The meeting of the simple, you know,<br/>
My daddy: the residual territorial using my money.<br/>
And Catherine, divided, split, you go.<br/>
Father, mother, trial of a triangle<br/>
With a river as a brief answer<br/>
And images of capital, which, short of this, arrive.<br/>
Apart from that, it&rsquo;s to be determined.<br/>
It is our intimate Claudio,<br/>
Forms of awful solvency.<br/>
We&rsquo;re all Callaway&rsquo;s and<br/>
It is at this that I call my cellphone<br/>
And at this that the production, reduction,<br/>
Extension of ten finds a family,<br/>
Meeting on the simple unit of competition.<br/>
It is on the mother that we can, soon,<br/>
And if it is sent everything is changed to get the family<br/>
On the factors of sofa reproductions,<br/>
Of conventions fine,<br/>
And all of these factors.<br/>
He&rsquo;s observer. However, not all of his desire<br/>
Is to determine the best.<br/>
I will be there, should be back on the familiar determinations.<br/>
With a reach personal, what the polls hopefully reveal:<br/>
A person, my clothes off,<br/>
A domain of scribbled images,<br/>
No less than configuration services for the point-signs,<br/>
The bricks, flows, sure figures, a couple of them<br/>
Sound like Apple computers.<br/>
I just want to drive, wake up on the workers,<br/>
Personify labor,<br/>
Talk to Dr. Slope, labor<br/>
In this way and it’s going to get in touch with you soon,<br/>
Just terrible things on the other side of the landscapers,<br/>
An image of a test to see you soon in five terrible crashes.</p>

<p>This initial example provides striking preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that the cipher responsible for this encoding is indeed something comparable to universal consciousness. How else would it be possible to obtain such a combination of fidelity and distortion at once puzzling and compellingly decipherable?</p>

<p>A more detailed analysis can be left to literary critics, but let us simply seize on the last several lines of this initial experiment. Obviously Deleuze and Guattari knew nothing of Apple computers, but here we learn that &ldquo;Bricks, flows, sure figures… sound like Apple computers.&rdquo; Apple computers are indeed crucially important, solid bricks keeping the creative energies of society harnessed and territorialized. They are &ldquo;sure figures&rdquo; whose continued technological development we can count on, our anticipation of which performs the critical function of keeping privileged and creative young adults in love with contemporary technocapitalism. The creative classes of Apple users do not labor but rather personify it, they furnish an acceptable image of labor. These Apple users are neurotically self-conscious of their distance from manual laborers: &ldquo;terrible things&rdquo; exist on that repressed, other side where landscapers labor with their bodies. The poem itself is only an image of a test, a portrait of what it might mean to confront these realities rather than repress them, a mere image of a test that everday we continually defer but which always finds us through the perpetual terror it provokes.</p>

		<p>To enter the galleries of modern painting from the main entrance of the National Gallery one has to walk through two separate and gargantuan gift stores and two equally impressive dining areas. But really, this is appropriate and historically honest curation. In short, the National Gallery makes visitors access modern painting in the same fashion as history itself has accessed it: through consumption, through the postmodern.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>My philosophy is shifting toward what I would like to term self-immiserative technomadism. The old Marxian hypothesis about the increasing immiseration of the working classes under capitalism has not fared well. The lowest classes apparently have more to lose than their chains, and thus one of the key revolutionary mechanisms theorized in the Marxist tradition is irrelevant in the advanced liberal democracies. I think an attractive solution is the self-immiseration of the disillusioned factions of the bourgeoisie. That is, I am increasingly convinced that to see the world clearly and to avoid all of the social investments that make us conservative and reactionary, we need to opt for a calculated kind of squalor. Not the demoralizing, unprovocative kind of squalor too often associated with traditional drifters, dropouts, and squatters, but an intellectually, artistically, politically radical kind of squalor. Technomadism is the name for just one component of this calculated squalor: it implies minimizing everything that keeps us anchored in the status quo (and thus blind to and invested in the status quo) in order to maximize the freedom, effectivity, and productivity of our connections to increasingly dominant technological desiring machines.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, I paid $20 to Skype for a personal phone number good for three months. Incoming calls are free (as far as I can tell) and $14 more got me credits for making calls, which are only 2.3 cents/minute. Say I speak for 5 minutes per day, which is more than I typically do, that means $14 gets me almost 5 months. I am breaking my cell phone contract ($110) rather than pay $50/month for the next nine months until my contract is over. <strong>Friends</strong>: <strong>You will find my new phone number on my Facebook page. It comes with voicemail, too. If you ever really need me, I&rsquo;d suggest you first email or message me on Facebook because I am always on both of those.</strong></p>

<p>I am doing this for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saving money. I hate bills and I hate cell phone companies. At $50/month that is about $600/year. At $20 every three months, and $14 every 5, that will be less than $150/year. I will save 600 &ndash; 150 = $450/year.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phones are stupid machines. If you have a smart phone, it might not be as stupid as most but it is still stupid. They have a penchant for jumping into toilets, distracting you from more interesting things, ringing during class/meetings/conversations, breaking, and being stolen. I despise all of these things and I&rsquo;m looking forward to putting them behind me.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phones are oppressive. To me, ignoring calls is rude and if someone calls me while I&rsquo;m not necessarily immediately busy, I owe it to him or her to pick up. Cell phones stay in your pocket all the time and they offer you no acceptable reason for not talking on the phone if you are able. In maximizing your accessibility in a sense you maximize your freedom of movement, but paradoxically you make yourself beholden to anyone calling you at any time and thus you limit your freedom (unless you ignore calls or turn your phone off, options I never found attractive.)</p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Suzanne Goldenberg of the <em>Guardian</em> reports a graph, apparently by <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/spais/people/person/148552">Matthew Hope</a> of the University of Bristol, to illustrate the claim that Obama is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">less interested in climate change than Bush</a>. This comes on the heels of several critics who point out that Obama did not mention climate change once in his past State of the Union address. The graph displays aggregate mentions of &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environnment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfutfsoliB1qz9517.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>However, as Ben Jervey of <em>Good</em> points out, Goldenberg&rsquo;s inference from her analysis <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">is wrong</a>. As Jervey suggests, Obama&rsquo;s lack of interest in &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; is due simply to a shift in rhetorical strategy, as Obama has chosen to frame the problems of climate change as an issue of &ldquo;clean energy.&rdquo; An analysis similar to Goldenberg&rsquo;s provides some compelling evidence for the latter view. Below, I&rsquo;m posting a graph comparable to Goldenberg&rsquo;s but with mentions of &ldquo;energy&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo; As graphics should, this largely speaks for itself:<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfuudeGs1v1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2010/09/19/abigail/" itemprop="url">Abigail asks a question</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A story for children</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>It was early in the morning and Abigail was preparing for her very first day of school when she stopped for a moment and looked up at her mother nervously. Abigail asked a question. To her it seemed very simple. “Why do I have to go school?” Abigail did not really want to stay home. She just wanted to know why she had to go to school. Her mother, busy as mothers sometimes are, did not seem to take her question too seriously. Our Abigail, on the other hand, was a perfectly serious little thinker, but since she did not want to distract or bother her good mother, she decided not to push too hard with tough questions. Abigail had a knack for difficult questions.</p>

<p>Abigail went through her first four classes with happy amazement! School was so weird to her! She could not understand why she was not allowed to eat snacks during class or why the teachers put so many different things on the walls! She thought it was so silly that she had to ask permission just to go to the bathroom! Abigail thought it was funny and interesting, so she went through her first four classes with her eyes wide open, trying her hardest to understand the place! Even the outside of the school—the playing fields and all the grass—had a fence around it with locks and security guards, so that even the outside was inside the school. It really was an odd place. Abigail kept wondering why she had to be there.</p>

<p>After the first four classes, Abigail got to go outside and play with the other kids. While all the other kids were just happy to be outside, Abigail walked around asking everyone her question. Many of her classmates did not understand why she was asking the question. Some of the other kids thought she was making a funny joke. Some of the other kids thought it was a good question and they wanted to know the answer, too! Still some other kids thought her question was stupid and annoying and told her to go away! She even thought the teachers were watching her as if she was up to trouble, even though she was behaving very well!</p>

<p>Abigail could not understand why this question would receive such different responses but no good answer! Abigail really wanted to know. She decided that she was going to ask all of her teachers for the rest of the day until she got an answer! Three subjects left gave her three chances before she went home that day. When she told the other students this, then the students found something they could all agree on. Abigail might ask some of the teachers but she would never even think about asking the math teacher! Everyone knew the math teacher was the meanest and that Abigail would keep her mouth shut for math class.</p>

<h3>Period Five, English, Miss Benna Benign</h3>

<p>In period five, the teacher was very nice and she very kindly told all the students that they could ask any questions at any time. Immediately, Abigail asked, “Why do we all have to come to school?” The teacher was nice so she smiled and said, “It’s for your own good! So you learn everything you need to know!” But our Abigail was a smart girl. She knew this was not the true answer, because Miss Benign’s answer did not tell Abigail what Abigail needed to know!</p>

<h3>Period Six, Social Studies, Mr. Patrick Priggish, PhD</h3>

<p>Social studies, during period six, was taught by a very smart teacher, so Abigail was sure she would get a good answer from him. A few minutes into class, Abigail raised her hand and asked, “Why do we all have to come to school?” And Mr. Priggish was so smart that by the time he was done saying a whole bunch of really smart things, Abigail could tell he forgot about her question! “Well, Abigail,” he began,  “schools have been around for thousands of years&hellip;a lot of different purposes&hellip;many kinds of schools…SOCIALLY INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT…” That was it! Mr. Priggish was lost in his own thoughts, Abigail could tell. Some of the other students thought they were the ones who got lost, but our Abigail was a good learner and she was starting to understand how these teachers work!</p>

<h3>Period Seven, Math, Mrs. Danielle Disdainful-Derisive</h3>

<p>When period seven began, Abigail could tell that Mrs. Disdainful-Derisive really was mean! But Abigail did not worry. She knew that if she behaved herself, and did not break any rules, she would be just fine. A few minutes into the class, a few of the other students were shocked when Abigail raised her hand. When Abigail was called on, she asked very calmly, “Why do we all have to come to school?” Abigail heard some of the students chuckle and she saw some of them look away in fear for her! The teacher made a funny face because she did not know what to say, and because she did not know what to say, she got angry! “Your question has nothing to do with math! It is irrefutably irrelevant…outrageously off-topic…ca…ca…ca…cantankerously counterproductive! Go to the principal’s office right now!”</p>

<p>Abigail could not believe it. What did she do? Oh, she was so confused! She wanted to go home and never come back. What were her parents going to say?</p>

<h3>Principal Grayhair Garfunkel</h3>

<p>When Abigail entered the principal’s office, she was surprised to see a very old man with a very gentle appearance.</p>

<p>“Abigail, were you keeping Mrs. Disdainful-Derisive from conducting her lesson?”</p>

<p>“No, well, I thought my question was part of the lesson!”</p>

<p>“She said you asked a question that had nothing to do with the lesson, that you were trying to be a smart alec, just to tease her and to distract the other students.”</p>

<p>“No! I just wanted to know the answer!”</p>

<p>“What was the question, Abigail?”</p>

<p>“Why do we have to come to school?” She looked a little nervous and embarrassed to ask her question yet again after all the trouble she caused.</p>

<p>Mr. Garfunkel saw that she was a good girl and that she was very nervous, and he responded kindly, “Ah, relax, Abigail. You know, we have heard this question before. Truthfully, it is not a bad question. Do you want me to tell you the answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, Abigail, you should be proud that you came upon this question at such a young age and that you had the courage to ask it. Most students never even think about it, and then most who do think of it would rather not ask it. I went to this school when I was your age, and I remember asking that same question! Nobody gave me a good answer and I was sent to the principal, too! And do you want to hear the funniest thing? Now, I AM the principal and have been for 30 years now, and I still have not learned a good answer to that question! And I’m the principal!</p>

<p>Listen, Abigail. Everyone just wants to go through their life and be happy in their own ways. Different people do this differently, and they invent different things to do different things. As you get older you will learn a lot about how people and things work, and I bet you already have today. There are always people who are bigger than you, and older than you, and smarter than you, and sometimes they force you to do things with no good answers for your questions! But if you keep your eyes open and trust your own ideas and questions, you’ll learn how people and things work. Do you know what happens next? Before you learn any of the answers, YOU are the principal and kids ask YOU why they have to come to school. You won’t KNOW the answer, but you’ll be free to respond however you think is best.”</p>

<p>Abigail, being a perfectly serious little thinker, started wondering how she would respond if someone asked her.</p>

<p>“You can go back to class now, Abigail.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Garfunkel,” Abigail said, gratefully, turning toward the door.</p>

<p>But before she made it through the door, Mr. Garfunkel called her name. She turned back around.</p>

<p>“Abigail, did I answer your question?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Mr. Garfunkel, I think so,” Abigail said, not perfectly certain but feeling much better about everything.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just the rise of religioius fundamentalism, it&rsquo;s more horrific than that. The loose cult we know as atheism, the ecclesiastics of which are well known, are the real defenders of the old faith, the old faith that somewhere the sliding stops, the faith that somewhere there exists a true <em>point de capiton</em>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Sure, Benjamin used hashish and mescaline; the hippies used pot, acid, and any number of other drugs. There are many examples of visionaries who used drugs. But today we have neither the erudition and discipline of a Benjamin, nor the capacity for love which the hippies still had. All we have is increasing atomism and incessant economic dislocations and disruptions. Contemporary recreational drugs, consequently, are misunderstood. Recreational drugs are still often seen as on the side of social change, a vague protest vote, from the critical and liberal-minded individuals opposed to outdated and provincial conservatives.</p>

<p>But the truth is that drugs do not transport one from a square and normal world to a place more fluid and free: the status quo is such an historical aberration, such an abnormal and inhuman disequilibrium, that recreational drug use typically quenches the <em>conservative</em> thirst to slow down incessant and unsettling change, to create an oasis of stability where the world might have a moment to make sense to itself.</p>

<p>Thus, it is an absurd ideological inversion only a capitalist society is capable of, that recreational drug cultures see themselves as on the side of change and their lawmakers&mdash;who in fact preside over daily planetary dislocations&mdash;as lacking flexibility.</p>
