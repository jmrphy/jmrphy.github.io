<li><p>The traditional cinematic representation of communication&mdash;the perfectly crafted, expertly balanced, and of course well-timed expressions of emotion&mdash;is a double bourgeois ruse. It tricks us first into thinking that to every true emotion belongs an elegant and compelling presentation that is always to the credit of the presenter, even to the Fool who is nonetheless always a well-executed Fool, and then into desiring and expecting such modes of expression from ourselves and others.</p></li>
<li><p>However, in truth, in practice, the communication of emotions is most often and in its essence difficult, ugly, stupid, awkward, silly, embarrassing, and most importantly, almost always to the discredit and social devaluation of the communicator. Those who disagree with this will quickly realize that any compelling example to the contrary is not the communication of an emotion but the mimicking of traditional cinematic representations of communication. So far from pleasing and admirable, genuine efforts to express emotions truthfully are in essence obscene and punished harshly. For instance, even schoolchildren learn that pouring one&rsquo;s heart out to a beloved, no matter how skillfully derived from the best of the silver screen, will be met consistently with rejection. He wants to put her in his pocket and she should die there, smothered&mdash;thus teaches D.H. Lawrence somewhere in <em>Sons and Lovers</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, a profound dissonance exists between the nature of emotions, especially the obscene possessive and obsessional qualities of love, and how the cinema teaches us to desire, communicate, and desire communication. The contemporary subject always feels compelled to find that perfect cinema-like expression of one&rsquo;s feelings toward the beloved, and in turn we want to hear such expressions directed toward us, yet, emotions being what they are, we begin to hate ourselves and others for never being able to successfully express emotions to the great effect we come to expect through so many cinematic representations.</p></li>
<li><p>Social institutions mediate this dissonance, known in another register as alienation. Why is the nature of romantic love always a kind of violent obsessive possessiveness? Because the legal fact and concrete phenomenon which most significantly conditions the distribution of enjoyment across society is <em>possession</em>. In fact, when norms of private possession so thoroughly dominate social relations, it can almost be said that possession of a thing is required for it to concretely exist to the beholder. One must possess the beloved because in our society if one does not possess a thing or a person then one cannot enjoy the thing or person, and in fact, the thing or person becomes a purely spectral object of fantasy, that which failed to become real. Why does the beloved flee at the honest confessions of the young lover? It is because we know no values other than values derived from the general mechanism of pricing, and in the love market one&rsquo;s value or price is reflected by one&rsquo;s eagerness: the honest plea of true love is seen as evidence that one is not worth enough to have already been obtained by someone better on whom the love is actually being spilled. We flee from honest passionate love like we flee from a salesman in too great a rush: he must be trying so hard so quick precisely because he isn&rsquo;t finding buyers, which tells us that his product is no good. And truly independent valuation is so rare! Furthermore, true romantic abandon is prohibited by the social and political organization of modern society, which demands the repression of liberality and lovemaking in favor of work, making oneself scarce and thus more valuable, etc. Thus we flee from precisely what we aim to actualize and express, if only we could find the right words (as they do in the movies).</p></li>
<li><p>The mumblecore film, especially insofar as it makes love speak as a stuttering neurotic rather than a confident, successful Romeo, has gone a certain distance in exposing this ruse of bourgeois cinema and pointing toward the truth of real emotional speech in all of its idiocy. But it has not gone far enough, chiefly because the stuttering neurotic succeeds in executing his role to wildly unrealistic personal advantage. The same cinematic valorization of emotional expression persists, only in a goofier, less traditionally elegant figure. Be yourself, stuttering and stammering, and you shall prevail. But the truth is that no, you will not: At best, you will feign a cinematically-endorsed version of charming, quirky, neurotic mumbling which is even harder to execute than the old role of Romeo; at worst, you will take the bait and actually be yourself and maybe add some stammering to boot, thereby frightening, traumatizing, and repulsing every new acquaintance.</p></li>
<li><p>It follows that if the essential discovery of the mumblecore project is to be mined to its full aesthetic potential, it must press toward devalorizing the mumbling subject the emotional communication of whom it has so preposterously glorified for so long. What this entails is calling forth the straightforwardly obscene, vile, rude, pathetic, silly, ugly, and stupid aspects of real emotional communication in a way that avoids, through whatever technical means available, any retrospective cinematic valorization. In other words, display the horror of emotional communication without permitting some redemptive quality to redound to the perpetrator of the horrible emotional drivel&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so honest!&rdquo; or &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so cool he doesn&rsquo;t even care how terrible he is!&rdquo; and so forth. Such impressions should be avoided at all costs, even through extra-cinematic didactic aids, if necessary. This will have the effect of bringing the truth of contemporary emotions into line with the truth of contemporary communication, namely, the line in which they are both hard, difficult, ugly, impossible: the truth of contemporary alienation. For instance, in my recent release <em>Open Bar Tender</em>, my very own character is stupid, insensitive, and despicable despite vain or even positively shameful efforts at damage control. And I was only &ldquo;being myself,&rdquo; the pathetic naive loon I am. Capturing the idiocy and cold terror of true, free emotional or artistic communication is one truth accessible to the mumblecore film, which can be beautiful as an assemblage without valorizing the communicating subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Whereas the devalorization of emotional communication is to begin perhaps most naturally in dialogic experimentation, it will be in narrative structure that the destiny of mumblecore unravels its next essential intimation: the mise en scene of the institutions that mediate the dissonance or alienation between the communication of the emotional subject and the truth of the emotions which are to be expressed. In short, if mumblecore is to unravel its essential discovery it must not be afraid to explicitly give treatment to the institutions which condition the mumbling subject, which teach the subject to mumble. Let us see subjects in the process of demystification, subjects resolving alienation in temporal developments at the end of which poetry and revolution meet in the sublime. Only through the mis en scene of concrete demystification should the mumbling subjects be permitted valorized speech and retrospective valorization more generally, for they will have earned it in a fashion consistent with an accurate conception of the relationship between emotional communication and the nature of real emotions.</p></li>

<p>Wants me god I wanted to come down. I&rsquo;m not a dot frog concern, I can do anything I do every single thing I don’t even know how to speak but I do it anyway I can translate in French no I barely know the language but I’m a French translator hi… I think we’re working on it and I am the owner of my cell phone and I do not know anything.</p>

<p>Hello there are about 18 people living here right now depending on what you call people and living but … and if you are here or there from … better than doing research on the place … third a third third a friend of a friend.</p>

<p>yeah so one of the things about this place and living with so many people living in a big warehouse and all and radical politics is that if you want things that you will soon want, that it’s like, on this village… but unfortunately it’s rather in the middle of a ticket going like some lingering derek and it’s quite like describing them like american cars, noxious because it’s politically in cold, really truly and kind of like… there’s a lifestyle it is like, broke possibly, but diverse and kind of real possibly… Unlikely I can put very improbable kind of words to it… convergence of the people pass here but… when a lot of people in your house have radical aspirations and kinda radical positions but the actual reality of it… surprisingly incredulously thick and we’re still kind of only just beginning really to understand… for ourselves, the community… that’s what they said that’s kind of happening lately and it’s kinda been like pointing itself out… as early as I was calling you… yeah so that’s the… for room and we went okay so we did a little loop around there… we can just go this way then… city so… this is the bathroom this is the main bathroom … otherwise known as the green bathroom or the tiger bathroom about there this is the only shower … and some of it most of it but … no I mean, looks like the hook ups were here about when we first moved in we had to … yeah we used to pay some guy but recently some occupiers from new haven these kids we know they&rsquo;ve been living in last week or two and they’re often knowing well really handy and in addition they’re fucking rad anyway so we&rsquo;re thinking hoping they&rsquo;re going to stay.</p>

<p>Hi some kind of anyways explanation just drinking a big gas energy drink do 1 jumping jack that&rsquo;s all you need especially if … exporting your time where the work precedents checking with you.</p>

<p>Lovely lady might suck I&rsquo;m gonna really wanna mix between … saint bernard and talk hey docks we&rsquo;re sending our image calling to … which obviously and then it would not look I&rsquo;m even I got those I make give me … a great game in the scene from … meeting love just … gonna since you good … please hey hopefully that lady is leaving at 1030 at order dot com.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;ve been there now I 1 … and like the 3 is only been there for I think this is like berger for we&rsquo;re just not serve you something like that anyway I like to hear you heard about the rate like great marco like go within like the kind of the report but he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the worst and like you know the now with my mom would like come in … hey like talk to you much hey jim like too crazy at work for most people so I like it but hi I just realize it&rsquo;s anne I just wanted to see that that would be all he does not know kinda handle crazy like crazy because I like what about things like you have later yes yeah well he didn&rsquo;t want to … like I can do anything please give me a ring freaking thing I&rsquo;m stalking you turned it let&rsquo;s catch up okay I don&rsquo;t what would you julie hi meet hey.</p>

<p>We are all guilty we are all guilty but the only thing we&rsquo;ve ever done that&rsquo;s dangerous the only crime we ever committed hey is unused potential, the shell, being ignored or pressed hey all we are dead and wait and we&rsquo;re dead space.</p>

<p>Hello that … hi this is … because he</p>

<p>With this wine I feel like I am part of that all right now I feel like I I feel absolutely sound into it would be easier I feel like I would go to like to go to sleep and 1 second wasn’t already…</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>To decide on an artistic or intellectual life is to believe that one is personally capable of contributing something new and valuable to human history. To believe oneself capable of such a feat is at once arrogant and quotidian, it is to see oneself as a genius but in a sense which all people rightfully ought to see themselves. Of course, every human being is just another thing evolved from millions of years of an idiotic (literally mindless) unfolding of the universe. Nonetheless, we have evolved a morality in which the real potential geniuses (the millions of latent artists and intellectuals and all other kinds of potential conscientious objectors) are afraid to truly see themselves as, and become, the geniuses they really are (for that is prideful and arrogant and egostistically delusional) and the lowest human beings (the truly vain) are the ones who always seem to earn this therefore dubious accreditation.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Traditional Freudian psychoanalysis, of course, posits the unconscious as the inherently inaccessible mental bedrock of conscious mental activity. It is, as the basic argument goes, the chaotic, non-logical, all-desiring source of mental energy—demanding at once the absolute proliferation of vitality and the absolute rest of death—the mad little homonculous which is controlled by the psychological machinery of conscioussness: repression, sublimation, projection, etc. With the insights of modern linguistics and especially the vocabulary of structuralism at his disposal, the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan was able to come right out and say that the unconscious is structured like a language.</p>

<p>That language, the way we talk and what we understand as sensible for speaking, represents a certain rationality, and thus a certain kind of morality. If you can’t say certain things because they don’t make sense given our current state of words and rules for words, then you can’t or are discouraged from doing things that correspond to such impossible sayings.</p>

<p>Algorithms of articifical intelligence have an inherently political dimension and at their frontier this dimension represents a precarious pivot between death and life, i.e. conservation and revolution. On the one hand, they interpret new information based on what they know about the past, and there is thus a rational tendency—founded on the very true, real inertia of real history—to assume that the new is like the old and to thus to impose old formulas on novel articulations. Thus, one component of the political unconscious revealed by Google’s speech-to-text algorithm will be the following: it will reveal at points the conservative obverse of linguistic novelties, how exactly the inert speech of the status quo is mathematically most likely to impose the weight of dead customary formulae onto even the most radical, innovative articulations. Thus, on one hand, Google’s transcription service is a kind of molecular linguistic Thermidor machine, mathematically reducing freedom of linguistic invention to that which is most common and dead</p>

<p>On the other hand, because of practical imperfections and simple technological inadequacies—errors induced by background noise, irregularities in human speech (speaking too fast or eliding syllables, slurs, stutters, etc.), differences in dialect, the algorithm’s inability to deal with any languages other than English despite penetration of English by many foreign tongues, etc.) misfired transcriptions of common, dead, bourgeois formulae will become accidental slips of the most profoundly revolutionary social imagination, as in dreams, the delirious ravings of schizophrenics, and so-called “Freudian slips.” Why do we claim that such erroneous transcriptions will have a profoundly revolutionary content? It is because, as errors, they will be outside the limits proscribed by status-quo reason, but by virtue of the best effort of the algorithm, they will be the best errors, the nonsensical, prohibited-by-reason errors which are nonetheless the very closest to reason itself: the errors contained within reasonable language.</p>

<p>One can invent, sui generis, radically innovative theories or images but these tend to be utopian, disconnected from the imminent logic of history and in fact such utopianism is usually a function of socially and politically manipulated fantasies if not designed then at least permitted and encouraged by the dominant powers, as when corporate advertising pitches us so many varieties of freedom only to make us work harder and spend more, to submit more, in order to obtain them. The most radically dangerous and truly revolutionary historical ruptures are those that are already imminently contained in the weighty, inescapable, all-pervasive, strictures of reasonable reality itself. Thus, when common expressions are transcribed erroneously the result represents a floating to the conscious top of the most saliently precarious links in the chain of signifiers that represents the symbolic order of reason, that status-quo itself. Not only can we rightfully deduce that such points of slippage are the most salient and precarious (precarious because prone to imminent reversal or subversion, salient because precarious) but the positive content the transcription assigns to such slipping links is by definition the socially and historically weightiest possible alternative, in other words the most practically realizable. Thus, the practical conclusion of this consideration is to be particularly keen with respect to politically inflected errors in the transcription of common expressions. The mathematics of artifical intelligence and natural-language learning suggest that such errors not only announce themselves as so many heels of Achilles in the rational defense of the established order but also reveal, scientifically, the most imminently practical line of flight.</p>

<p>The following poem was produced by reading a passage of Deleuze and Guattari&rsquo;s <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> into Google&rsquo;s transcription service. The errors and slippages are surprisingly coherent and suggestive, distinct and decisvely different than the original text, but connected to it by a cipher which is certainly not random.<br/>
When you can, Johnson,<br/>
Again.<br/>
Friends and family,<br/>
The meeting of the simple, you know,<br/>
My daddy: the residual territorial using my money.<br/>
And Catherine, divided, split, you go.<br/>
Father, mother, trial of a triangle<br/>
With a river as a brief answer<br/>
And images of capital, which, short of this, arrive.<br/>
Apart from that, it&rsquo;s to be determined.<br/>
It is our intimate Claudio,<br/>
Forms of awful solvency.<br/>
We&rsquo;re all Callaway&rsquo;s and<br/>
It is at this that I call my cellphone<br/>
And at this that the production, reduction,<br/>
Extension of ten finds a family,<br/>
Meeting on the simple unit of competition.<br/>
It is on the mother that we can, soon,<br/>
And if it is sent everything is changed to get the family<br/>
On the factors of sofa reproductions,<br/>
Of conventions fine,<br/>
And all of these factors.<br/>
He&rsquo;s observer. However, not all of his desire<br/>
Is to determine the best.<br/>
I will be there, should be back on the familiar determinations.<br/>
With a reach personal, what the polls hopefully reveal:<br/>
A person, my clothes off,<br/>
A domain of scribbled images,<br/>
No less than configuration services for the point-signs,<br/>
The bricks, flows, sure figures, a couple of them<br/>
Sound like Apple computers.<br/>
I just want to drive, wake up on the workers,<br/>
Personify labor,<br/>
Talk to Dr. Slope, labor<br/>
In this way and it’s going to get in touch with you soon,<br/>
Just terrible things on the other side of the landscapers,<br/>
An image of a test to see you soon in five terrible crashes.</p>

<p>This initial example provides striking preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that the cipher responsible for this encoding is indeed something comparable to universal consciousness. How else would it be possible to obtain such a combination of fidelity and distortion at once puzzling and compellingly decipherable?</p>

<p>A more detailed analysis can be left to literary critics, but let us simply seize on the last several lines of this initial experiment. Obviously Deleuze and Guattari knew nothing of Apple computers, but here we learn that &ldquo;Bricks, flows, sure figures… sound like Apple computers.&rdquo; Apple computers are indeed crucially important, solid bricks keeping the creative energies of society harnessed and territorialized. They are &ldquo;sure figures&rdquo; whose continued technological development we can count on, our anticipation of which performs the critical function of keeping privileged and creative young adults in love with contemporary technocapitalism. The creative classes of Apple users do not labor but rather personify it, they furnish an acceptable image of labor. These Apple users are neurotically self-conscious of their distance from manual laborers: &ldquo;terrible things&rdquo; exist on that repressed, other side where landscapers labor with their bodies. The poem itself is only an image of a test, a portrait of what it might mean to confront these realities rather than repress them, a mere image of a test that everday we continually defer but which always finds us through the perpetual terror it provokes.</p>

		<p>To enter the galleries of modern painting from the main entrance of the National Gallery one has to walk through two separate and gargantuan gift stores and two equally impressive dining areas. But really, this is appropriate and historically honest curation. In short, the National Gallery makes visitors access modern painting in the same fashion as history itself has accessed it: through consumption, through the postmodern.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>My philosophy is shifting toward what I would like to term self-immiserative technomadism. The old Marxian hypothesis about the increasing immiseration of the working classes under capitalism has not fared well. The lowest classes apparently have more to lose than their chains, and thus one of the key revolutionary mechanisms theorized in the Marxist tradition is irrelevant in the advanced liberal democracies. I think an attractive solution is the self-immiseration of the disillusioned factions of the bourgeoisie. That is, I am increasingly convinced that to see the world clearly and to avoid all of the social investments that make us conservative and reactionary, we need to opt for a calculated kind of squalor. Not the demoralizing, unprovocative kind of squalor too often associated with traditional drifters, dropouts, and squatters, but an intellectually, artistically, politically radical kind of squalor. Technomadism is the name for just one component of this calculated squalor: it implies minimizing everything that keeps us anchored in the status quo (and thus blind to and invested in the status quo) in order to maximize the freedom, effectivity, and productivity of our connections to increasingly dominant technological desiring machines.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, I paid $20 to Skype for a personal phone number good for three months. Incoming calls are free (as far as I can tell) and $14 more got me credits for making calls, which are only 2.3 cents/minute. Say I speak for 5 minutes per day, which is more than I typically do, that means $14 gets me almost 5 months. I am breaking my cell phone contract ($110) rather than pay $50/month for the next nine months until my contract is over. <strong>Friends</strong>: <strong>You will find my new phone number on my Facebook page. It comes with voicemail, too. If you ever really need me, I&rsquo;d suggest you first email or message me on Facebook because I am always on both of those.</strong></p>

<p>I am doing this for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saving money. I hate bills and I hate cell phone companies. At $50/month that is about $600/year. At $20 every three months, and $14 every 5, that will be less than $150/year. I will save 600 &ndash; 150 = $450/year.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phones are stupid machines. If you have a smart phone, it might not be as stupid as most but it is still stupid. They have a penchant for jumping into toilets, distracting you from more interesting things, ringing during class/meetings/conversations, breaking, and being stolen. I despise all of these things and I&rsquo;m looking forward to putting them behind me.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phones are oppressive. To me, ignoring calls is rude and if someone calls me while I&rsquo;m not necessarily immediately busy, I owe it to him or her to pick up. Cell phones stay in your pocket all the time and they offer you no acceptable reason for not talking on the phone if you are able. In maximizing your accessibility in a sense you maximize your freedom of movement, but paradoxically you make yourself beholden to anyone calling you at any time and thus you limit your freedom (unless you ignore calls or turn your phone off, options I never found attractive.)</p></li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Suzanne Goldenberg of the <em>Guardian</em> reports a graph, apparently by <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/spais/people/person/148552">Matthew Hope</a> of the University of Bristol, to illustrate the claim that Obama is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">less interested in climate change than Bush</a>. This comes on the heels of several critics who point out that Obama did not mention climate change once in his past State of the Union address. The graph displays aggregate mentions of &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environnment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfutfsoliB1qz9517.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>However, as Ben Jervey of <em>Good</em> points out, Goldenberg&rsquo;s inference from her analysis <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush">is wrong</a>. As Jervey suggests, Obama&rsquo;s lack of interest in &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; is due simply to a shift in rhetorical strategy, as Obama has chosen to frame the problems of climate change as an issue of &ldquo;clean energy.&rdquo; An analysis similar to Goldenberg&rsquo;s provides some compelling evidence for the latter view. Below, I&rsquo;m posting a graph comparable to Goldenberg&rsquo;s but with mentions of &ldquo;energy&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;environment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming.&rdquo; As graphics should, this largely speaks for itself:<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfuudeGs1v1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A story for children</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>It was early in the morning and Abigail was preparing for her very first day of school when she stopped for a moment and looked up at her mother nervously. Abigail asked a question. To her it seemed very simple. “Why do I have to go school?” Abigail did not really want to stay home. She just wanted to know why she had to go to school. Her mother, busy as mothers sometimes are, did not seem to take her question too seriously. Our Abigail, on the other hand, was a perfectly serious little thinker, but since she did not want to distract or bother her good mother, she decided not to push too hard with tough questions. Abigail had a knack for difficult questions.</p>

<p>Abigail went through her first four classes with happy amazement! School was so weird to her! She could not understand why she was not allowed to eat snacks during class or why the teachers put so many different things on the walls! She thought it was so silly that she had to ask permission just to go to the bathroom! Abigail thought it was funny and interesting, so she went through her first four classes with her eyes wide open, trying her hardest to understand the place! Even the outside of the school—the playing fields and all the grass—had a fence around it with locks and security guards, so that even the outside was inside the school. It really was an odd place. Abigail kept wondering why she had to be there.</p>

<p>After the first four classes, Abigail got to go outside and play with the other kids. While all the other kids were just happy to be outside, Abigail walked around asking everyone her question. Many of her classmates did not understand why she was asking the question. Some of the other kids thought she was making a funny joke. Some of the other kids thought it was a good question and they wanted to know the answer, too! Still some other kids thought her question was stupid and annoying and told her to go away! She even thought the teachers were watching her as if she was up to trouble, even though she was behaving very well!</p>

<p>Abigail could not understand why this question would receive such different responses but no good answer! Abigail really wanted to know. She decided that she was going to ask all of her teachers for the rest of the day until she got an answer! Three subjects left gave her three chances before she went home that day. When she told the other students this, then the students found something they could all agree on. Abigail might ask some of the teachers but she would never even think about asking the math teacher! Everyone knew the math teacher was the meanest and that Abigail would keep her mouth shut for math class.</p>

<h3>Period Five, English, Miss Benna Benign</h3>

<p>In period five, the teacher was very nice and she very kindly told all the students that they could ask any questions at any time. Immediately, Abigail asked, “Why do we all have to come to school?” The teacher was nice so she smiled and said, “It’s for your own good! So you learn everything you need to know!” But our Abigail was a smart girl. She knew this was not the true answer, because Miss Benign’s answer did not tell Abigail what Abigail needed to know!</p>

<h3>Period Six, Social Studies, Mr. Patrick Priggish, PhD</h3>

<p>Social studies, during period six, was taught by a very smart teacher, so Abigail was sure she would get a good answer from him. A few minutes into class, Abigail raised her hand and asked, “Why do we all have to come to school?” And Mr. Priggish was so smart that by the time he was done saying a whole bunch of really smart things, Abigail could tell he forgot about her question! “Well, Abigail,” he began,  “schools have been around for thousands of years&hellip;a lot of different purposes&hellip;many kinds of schools…SOCIALLY INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT…” That was it! Mr. Priggish was lost in his own thoughts, Abigail could tell. Some of the other students thought they were the ones who got lost, but our Abigail was a good learner and she was starting to understand how these teachers work!</p>

<h3>Period Seven, Math, Mrs. Danielle Disdainful-Derisive</h3>

<p>When period seven began, Abigail could tell that Mrs. Disdainful-Derisive really was mean! But Abigail did not worry. She knew that if she behaved herself, and did not break any rules, she would be just fine. A few minutes into the class, a few of the other students were shocked when Abigail raised her hand. When Abigail was called on, she asked very calmly, “Why do we all have to come to school?” Abigail heard some of the students chuckle and she saw some of them look away in fear for her! The teacher made a funny face because she did not know what to say, and because she did not know what to say, she got angry! “Your question has nothing to do with math! It is irrefutably irrelevant…outrageously off-topic…ca…ca…ca…cantankerously counterproductive! Go to the principal’s office right now!”</p>

<p>Abigail could not believe it. What did she do? Oh, she was so confused! She wanted to go home and never come back. What were her parents going to say?</p>

<h3>Principal Grayhair Garfunkel</h3>

<p>When Abigail entered the principal’s office, she was surprised to see a very old man with a very gentle appearance.</p>

<p>“Abigail, were you keeping Mrs. Disdainful-Derisive from conducting her lesson?”</p>

<p>“No, well, I thought my question was part of the lesson!”</p>

<p>“She said you asked a question that had nothing to do with the lesson, that you were trying to be a smart alec, just to tease her and to distract the other students.”</p>

<p>“No! I just wanted to know the answer!”</p>

<p>“What was the question, Abigail?”</p>

<p>“Why do we have to come to school?” She looked a little nervous and embarrassed to ask her question yet again after all the trouble she caused.</p>

<p>Mr. Garfunkel saw that she was a good girl and that she was very nervous, and he responded kindly, “Ah, relax, Abigail. You know, we have heard this question before. Truthfully, it is not a bad question. Do you want me to tell you the answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, Abigail, you should be proud that you came upon this question at such a young age and that you had the courage to ask it. Most students never even think about it, and then most who do think of it would rather not ask it. I went to this school when I was your age, and I remember asking that same question! Nobody gave me a good answer and I was sent to the principal, too! And do you want to hear the funniest thing? Now, I AM the principal and have been for 30 years now, and I still have not learned a good answer to that question! And I’m the principal!</p>

<p>Listen, Abigail. Everyone just wants to go through their life and be happy in their own ways. Different people do this differently, and they invent different things to do different things. As you get older you will learn a lot about how people and things work, and I bet you already have today. There are always people who are bigger than you, and older than you, and smarter than you, and sometimes they force you to do things with no good answers for your questions! But if you keep your eyes open and trust your own ideas and questions, you’ll learn how people and things work. Do you know what happens next? Before you learn any of the answers, YOU are the principal and kids ask YOU why they have to come to school. You won’t KNOW the answer, but you’ll be free to respond however you think is best.”</p>

<p>Abigail, being a perfectly serious little thinker, started wondering how she would respond if someone asked her.</p>

<p>“You can go back to class now, Abigail.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Garfunkel,” Abigail said, gratefully, turning toward the door.</p>

<p>But before she made it through the door, Mr. Garfunkel called her name. She turned back around.</p>

<p>“Abigail, did I answer your question?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Mr. Garfunkel, I think so,” Abigail said, not perfectly certain but feeling much better about everything.</p>
