		<p>The problem with self-reflection is that it&rsquo;s a non-linear system. Under certain conditions, the smallest kernel of anxiety grows exponentially because we feel anxiety about having anxiety. And the smaller the original anxiety—that is, the more trite the original problem—the more ashamed and embarrassed we are for even feeling it in the first place, and the greater the rate at which the original minor anxiety morphs into a generalized neurosis.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2013/02/17/a-note-on-masculinity-and-self-expression/" itemprop="url">A note on masculinity and self-expression</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>One characteristically masculine technique of expression is to translate feelings of fear and insecurity into verbal and gestural forms of aggression and bids for power. In other words: not expression at all, but rather the opaque, instrumental action of concretely attempting to remove an irritation by subduing its real or imagined sources. Not depleting or reducing fear and insecurity but simply displacing them onto others. What the average man expects from women, and indeed requires from them, in order to exist with the fears and insecurities he knows no other way to deal with, is the woman&rsquo;s passive compliance with this masculinist formula of translating felt fears and insecurities into aggression, and many popular tropes about male-female romance only catalog the most traditional and well-known ways in which women have figured out how to cope with these strategic ruses of masculine dissimulation which are intended to pass for expression. Women who are no longer willing to shoulder all of this displaced insecurity and fear are, for obvious reasons, an extremely fearful threat to the traditional man. If such traditional men were simply backward, hopeless fools with whom it&rsquo;s not even worth bothering, then perhaps we could simply write them off as too far gone. Then those of us with radical interests would have no real reason to be too concerned with the difficulties these men face in coming to terms with the truth of feminism. But it is not so easy because it must be admitted that even we men who are absolutely committed to learning and understanding the nature of patriarchy and are actually committed to changing our practices in a way consistent with the liberation of all people, the truth is that we don&rsquo;t currently have alternative ways of dealing with the fears and insecurities we all suffer from. And it cannot be treated as a matter of heroism: &ldquo;I will just deal with it, I have no right to complain, because I&rsquo;m just a privileged man in a patriarchal society,&rdquo; without this, too, being itself a patriarchal and masculinist recourse.</p>

<p>In other words, those interested in a radical collective resistance against patriarchy have to develop practices that allow men to deal with their insecurities and fears in a way that does not revert to partaking in ultimately masculinist stances. An opposite strategy is to forego all masculinist techniques, to sort of submit or offer oneself unconditionally, to say &ldquo;here I am, relinquishing myself of the only techniques I know for dealing with my securities and fears, here I am, nothing but insecurities and fears, and, in my refusal to displace these fears and insecurities onto others but having no other techniques for dealing with them, I will simply show them and reveal them in honesty.&rdquo; The difficulty here, again, is that the emotional difficulties of such a horrific ordeal of revelation and self-flagellation typically fall onto the shoulders of those who care. Historically, of course, it is on women that the burden of such care labor typically falls, making this strategy of absolutely candid surrender likely to backfire. Another way it backfires is that this sort of practice is truly quite grotesque, monstrous; it is literally inhuman insofar as it is basically the act of relinquishing all of the characteristically human, that is to say dissimulative and instrumental techniques for being in the world and presenting ourselves in the world as subjects. Needless to say, this inhumanity, although perhaps commendable on some ultimate scale, is quite exactly the opposite of what is attractive to humans, and it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to actually live with. The point worth stressing is that alternatives to the dead-ends of masculine self-expression are not readily available; it&rsquo;s not clear that anyone knows how to resist and replace them in a way that does not take recourse to some sort of instrumentalism and exploitation at some level.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2013/02/16/400-the-vertigo-of-social-mobility/" itemprop="url">The vertigo of social mobility</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Institutions lure you by flattering you, in a world where it is nearly impossible to find recognition outside of them; you begin to see yourself only in institutions that pre-exist you and over which you exercise no influence. If this is perfectly internalized, then you get typical neuroses, mid-life crises, etc. Alternatively, if it&rsquo;s not perfectly internalized, then you get perpetual, mini crises up front; you perpetually realize you&rsquo;re over-worked and over-working on things that are somehow sterilized in advance so as to make sure you cannot exercise freedom over them and you also realize that no matter how hard you work you will not overcome this impotence. The mythology of hard work is, for this reason, indispensable for the status quo; it&rsquo;s one of the only things that keeps people from realizing that they simply can&rsquo;t win, that nobody can win like that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, growing dependent on such an institution for the most essential and elemental psychological needs is a most deadly vulnerability because, when one steps back from the institution for one&rsquo;s own freedom, to the exact degree one is accustomed to the flattery of that institution, one will feel stupid and worthless and suffer all kinds of the most pathetic problems and embarrassments in trying to step back. This is why the businessman in mid-life crisis is one of the most pathetic figures. However, every downturn of self-esteem that comes from such a precarious and self-betraying identification with an institution, tends to produce an upturn in at least one thing: economic consumption. For, the one thing the institutions will give you is money. And they&rsquo;ll give it to you precisely to the degree you&rsquo;re capable of doing something intense outside of an institution; nothing gets a higher price than that and intellectual history is replete with examples. When the life of the mind faulters and there is money in the bank, an almost automatic transference of energy takes place in which the mind fixates on some new thing to buy. Most important in this respect are upper-class goods such as nice clothing and nice housing. &ldquo;Why am I so stressed and neurotic?&rdquo; they ask themselves. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t have the proper materials for such an important life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because money is the only thing the institutions ultimately offer you, there is an overwhelming tendency to spend it upwards so to speak&mdash;so as to alleviate the stresses incurred in earning it. This point is perhaps banal, but the less observed point here is not just the material compensation of purchased pleasures for working stress; it&rsquo;s that the things purchased actually come to convince people of the legitimacy of the social distribution of resources. &ldquo;I need a nice sunny loft apartment all to myself because I need to focus and that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m most creative, because I am an academic.&rdquo; In fact, the exact opposite is the truth: I need a nice sunny loft apartment precisely because I&rsquo;m not an academic, so that in trying to be one for money I get so stressed and distracted I can&rsquo;t even do it how most people live, so I have to spend this money on a new apartment, etc. Then, lo and behold, all of the material and psychological vertigo of upward mobility comes along. That vertigo is real, it is the <em>real movement</em> as the Marxists like to say, of being distributed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>We fetishize words in such a way that when someone says something, we are prone to find them outrageously evil should they choose certain words. But the reality is that the actual quality of human drives probably differs much less across history and space than we wish to believe. This sense is inflated by the significance we attach to particular words, and distorted in severe biases in the social distribution of verbal facility. This is evidenced by the fact that the average, &ldquo;well-bred&rdquo;, sensitive, educated person, almost certainly plays very often, in their head, with certain extremely uncouth and perhaps even wildly offensive ideas and phrasings before instantly knowing or realizing, precisely on account of their well bred discrimination, that such words would likely incur severe social punishment within their peer group. Those who are decent and polite are usually only well educated, which means they&rsquo;re merely better trained in the repression and verbal dissimulation of evil compared to the uneducated who are far more likely to spew all kinds of bigotry in public.</p>

<p>This all suggests a really interesting convergence of the two opposite meanings of the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;: namely that the dominant classes who benefit from social institutions of racial, gender, and class discrimination in the political sense, are precisely those who have the most trained sense of &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; in the valorized sense of nuance. The same base human drives that more or less unite us all, and the same overarching social institutions organize all of our habits and tendencies, even if they distribute us differentially. The ability to &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo; in the good sense, is itself a privilege of discrimination in the bad sense. We must try to understand better that occupying a position in that discriminate classes in no way makes us better or less evil than people who are simply less adept at hiding their tracks. Ours is simply a different kind of evil, an evil that we have stuffed under layers and layers of torturously complicated rationales, but which is most manifest at the material level of that which we actually enjoy at the cost of the suffering of so many others. There is, then, a certain overall equality of evil in a society such as ours where that evil is so thoroughly mediated and distributed by institutions, such that for some it is transparent and unadorned much to the criticism of the public mind, while for others it is simply buried, dissimulated, and finally rewarded.</p>

		<p>Most people are sensitive in their relations with loved ones but insensitive to the far greater suffering of others. This is disastrous for the loved ones as well as humanity in general. The real challenge for loved ones must be to treat each other with loving <em>insensitivity</em>, a mutual respect so deep that it is impossible to silently indulge the other’s flaws and weaknesses. This is not only a truer and more mutually empowering path for the loved ones, but perhaps even more importantly, it reserves one’s limited resources of sensitivity for maintaining the highest possible degree of awareness and protest toward the rest of the world’s deepest and most urgent varieties of human suffering.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>During the Israeli-Palestinian attacks of last month, I scraped from the Twitter API about 270,000 tweets containing the hashtag #gazaunderattack. Given the unprecedented degree to which this war was fought online, tweets of this sort could and should become really important data for political scientists. I&rsquo;m too busy right now to say very much here, but I want to share some basic descriptive analyses for anyone who might be interested. The dataset can be downloaded <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20498362/tweets_%23gazaunderattack.csv">here</a> and the R script that produced these analyses is available at the very bottom.</p>

<p>Almost everything in this post I learned how to do directly and solely from the amazingly smart, open and generous #Rstats community. The scraping and time-series plot follow a script by <a href="http://bommaritollc.com/2011/02/26/archiving-tweets-with-python/">Michael Bommarito</a>, and the rest follows scripts by <a href="https://github.com/benmarwick/AAA2011-Tweets/blob/master/AAA2011.R">Ben Marwick</a>.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>There are 269,158 tweets. These tweets are authored by 79,923 unique users. Of all the tweets, .62 are retweets.</p>

<p>This first graph plots the frequency of #gazaunderattack tweets in 30-minute intervals between November 17th and November 21st. I <em>believe</em> this is <em>all</em> of the tweets containing that hashtag within this period. I know the Twitter Search API is subject to weird filters and restrictions, but I believe the technique I used here pages through each and every tweet available within the available time period.</p>

<p>Most frequent #gazaunderattack tweeters.</p>

<p>The most retweeted tweeters. Interestingly, Anonymous seems to have had more reach, at least during this period, than the twitter account of Hamas (@AlqassamBrigade).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/retweet_counts.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/retweet_counts.png" alt="retweet_counts" /></a></em>The most retweeted tweeters as a ratio of total quantity of tweets sent.   Anonymous still seems to have had the most reach on the #gazaunderattack hashtag.</p>

		<p>Political scientists <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/25/will-2012-be-a-low-turnout-election-some-evidence-from-google-search-activity/%23comments">Jesse Richman</a> and <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/25/google-searches-and-turnout-a-cautionary-tale/">Erik Voeten</a> wonder if Google Search data can help us predict turnout in next month&rsquo;s Presidential election. To summarize, Richman finds that searches for &ldquo;vote&rdquo; in the past two elections predict voter turnout, and that low search volume for &ldquo;vote&rdquo; this year suggests a low turnout election. In response, Voeten shows that controlling for who has come online since 2004 and 2008 explains much of why search volume for &ldquo;vote&rdquo; appears small this year. There are lots of reasons search data is pretty tricky for making good inferences, but that shouldn&rsquo;t keep us from trying!</p>

<p>My thinking is that we can look at the <em>composition</em> of &ldquo;vote&rdquo; searches across elections to see whether this year&rsquo;s vote searches are indicative of greater voter turnout or greater voter demobilization/skepticism.</p>

<p>For instance, &ldquo;vote&rdquo; searches containing the terms &ldquo;where&rdquo; or &ldquo;when&rdquo; are probably more directly predictive of turning out to vote than the whole set of &ldquo;vote&rdquo; searches&mdash;as they indicate practical planning to turnout. On the other hand, &ldquo;vote&rdquo; searches containing the term &ldquo;why&rdquo; are probably far less predictive of turnout&mdash;and might even predict how many people are thinking &ldquo;why bother?&rdquo; and are considering staying home on election day.</p>

<p>So I went back to the data with this in mind. As baseline and as Voeten shows, if we consider voting searches (&ldquo;vote&rdquo; and &ldquo;voting&rdquo; together) as a proportion of searches for &ldquo;university&rdquo;, &ldquo;science&rdquo;, and &ldquo;law&rdquo;, this election hardly looks very different. So that&rsquo;s just (vote+voting) / ((university+science+law) / 3). As explained in the posts linked above, search volume data is scaled from 0 to 100 where 100 is the peak of that search term in the given time period, relative to all other search activity.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/whyvotesearches.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/whyvotesearches.png" alt="" /></a>But when we look at voting searches also containing the words &ldquo;where&rdquo; and &ldquo;when&rdquo; (I take the average of vote+where and vote+when as a proportion of the university-science-law index), more people appear to be asking where and when to vote this year than in the past two Presidential elections. The p-value on the difference of means between 2008 and 2012 is .051.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/votingplansearches.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/votingplansearches.png" alt="" /></a>Finally, I look at the difference between the why-vote searches and the where/when-vote searches. The gap might be taken as an aggregate measure of how much society is using the web to <em>think about</em> the decision to turn out <em>without planning</em> to turnout, so that positive values might capture demobilization within vote searches (why bother?) and negative values reflect relatively resolved mobilization. And what we find is that this whole election year shows greater &ldquo;when/where&rdquo; vote searches than &ldquo;why&rdquo; vote searches at the present moment in the timeline but also for the year as a whole. In both of the previous elections there were more &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; searches than &ldquo;planning&rdquo; searches, but this year there have been more planning searches. As in the previous analyses, these are as a proportion of the university-science-law index, and the difference of means for 2008 and 2012 is statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/thinkplangapusl.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/thinkplangapusl.png" alt="" /></a>Arguably, this difference variable perhaps already controls for education or political information because each term reflects a lack of knowledge, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be inflated by less educated/informed people coming online since 2004 and 2008. But the same pattern is evident and statistically significant if we look at this gap as a proportion of all &ldquo;politics&rdquo; search volume or just the raw differences of volume. Obviously, these are back-of-the napkin analyses and these data are plagued by difficulties. But these analyses don&rsquo;t suggest a low-turnout election in 2012. If anything, it looks like the web is registering more vote planning than in previous years.</p>
