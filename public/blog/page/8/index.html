	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I am on the third floor of the museum of the Art Institute of Chicago; I am sitting in a room with two Rothko color fields—I almost wanted to write “<em>of two Rothko color fields”</em>—each hanging alone, diametrically, on interior walls, walls which permit guests to flow in and out of the adjacent rooms. I am sitting on the floor halfway between the two large canvases and over to one side. I am obstructing the flow of people but will be forgiven; in a museum, serious attentiveness is so hard and rare that the philistine is sufficiently impressed to forgive you anything in its name.</p>

<p>The two paintings are the <em>Untitled (Purple, White, and Red)</em> of 1953 and the yellow and orange <em>Untitled</em> of 1953-54. The curatorial placard for the former offers a cliché about Rothko’s mature paintings more generally, that it reflects his “metaphysical aims” of offering “a doorway into purely spiritual realms, making it as immaterial and evocative as music, and to directly communicate the most essential, raw forms of human emotion.” Perhaps, sure. However, as early as 1936, Rothko began writing a book, which he would never finish, about the affinities between children’s art and that of modern painting. Does this unfinished project not justify us in approaching these paintings naively, as children might, and as their frank simplicity seems to demand?</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6tbrozSGQ1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Mark Rothko.__ Untitled (Purple, White, and Red)</em>. 1953. Oil on canvas. 197.5 x 207.7 cm (77 3/4 x 81 3/4 in.)</p>

<p>I return to my seat on the floor. Why three distinct blocks of color in the canvas of 1953 and only two in the canvas of 1953-54? An almost stupid question, but why not? Even these two paintings by themselves suggest a hypothesis that is obviously confirmed from the perspective of Rothko’s writings and the development of his career over time, from his early experiments in figuration to the later color fields and even within the color fields, which (roughly, and with exceptions) move from bright multiplicities to darker and largely bichromatic fields approaching the monochrome. Clearly, he is interested in a certain process of purification, of reduction. In his writings, he affirms the movements of “generalization,” of “reduction.”</p>

<p><em>     <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6tblrkbxC1qz9517.png" alt="" /></em></p>

<p><em>Mark Rothko. __Untitled (Painting)</em>, 1953-54.Oil on canvas. 265.1 x 298.1 cm (104 3/8 x 117 3/8 in.)</p>

<p>But it is reasonable to wonder, if all that remains are abstract fields of color, what exactly is being purified or reduced? There is no <em>thing</em> left, no apparent object or message the painter could be said to have successfully purified. However, there is indeed <em>something</em> left, because Rothko never painted purely monochromatic fields, of which one could arguably say that there is truly <em>nothing there</em>. The thing Rothko never abandoned, what I would argue is the main theme, object, and obsession of his color fields, is merely the exploration of the <em>distinction</em> between fields, distinction in and of itself. One of the bedrock presuppositions of any artistic product, any <em>thing</em> at all for that matter, is some minimum of distinction. That is, <em>distinctions</em> or <em>boundaries</em> are the essential and irreducibile unit of artistic production or creative activity more generally; boundaries, whether physical or conceptual, which say: this is this, this is a thing and not everything else around it. Anyone who is to call themselves a human being, a thinking and acting individual who supposedly possesses a will to do or make things, must maintain some minimum capacity for the construction of distinctions or boundaries or else be nothing more than a flesh-colored speck on the one great canvas of the blind, deaf, and dumb universe.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6tbiqKt1S1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Barnett Newman. <em>Shining Forth (To George)</em>. 1961. Oil on canvas. 114 x 174 in.(289.6 x 441.9 cm)</p>

<p>In this light, it could be said that the history of painting before distinction itself becomes foregrounded in works such as those of Rothko and Newman, the history of surfaces that portray just so many <em>things</em>, so many figures, so many stunning physical and mental vistas, so many alternate universes—it could be said that this history is fundamentally untruthful. Clearly, the great biblical antagonists of epic Christian canvases on some obvious level are not real and never existed. And of course it has been said at least since Plato that any and all artistic <em>representation</em> itself is a sort of fakery. But, on the other hand, we are accustomed to thinking that artistic license is essentially the right to tell lies in the name of some higher ideal.</p>

<p>Now, if we return to Rothko’s reading of the history of painting, we recall his sensitivity to the social and political conditions peculiar to modernity. Classical painters had the advantage of a religious, political, social, and economic order maintained by the force of centralized institutions that explicitly justified themselves by reference to overarching Truth. Even into the Renaissance period, the disproportionate share of power enjoyed by the rich and noble was justified because they truly believed in a Great Chain of Being that allocates to certain classes of people the right to dominate other classes of people. Artists, as we have already mentioned, could pretend to comply with the demands of powerful patrons but then take liberties at the margins to enjoy at least a modicum of creative freedom and at best perhaps a genuinely efficacious participation in the stewardship of history.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of modernity, however, is that our religious, political, social, and economic order is enforced by a progressive <em>disavowal</em> of overarching Truth. Today, we accept that some classes of people have a disproportionate share of power and dominate subordinate classes of people <em>because</em> we do not believe in the existence of any inherent Truth about who should get what or who should tell who what to do. If someone gets rich, it’s because they did what they needed to do to get rich, now they are rich, and what the hell does Truth have to do with it? If someone is poor, they are poor, and they have the right to get rich and they have the right to remain poor—<em>the right to starve</em>, as Rothko says.</p>

<p>In other words, premodern doctrines such as that of the Great Chain of Being are rigid ideological systems characterized by clear distinctions and bright lines distributing and demarcating <em>inter alia</em> status, occupation, behavior, and income for various classes of people. For modern capitalism to emerge, it would be necessary for an emergent bourgeoisie to contest this rigid ideology. In religion, the Reformation was a revolt against centralized, clerical claims to spiritual truth. In philosophy and politics, skepticism toward the claims of monarchs to divine right resulted in the successful bourgeois political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. In economics, Smith and Ricardo demonstrated the errors of a morally-inflected economic statism (consider the consistent if variable prohibitions of usury in premodernity) and paternalistic mercantilism in favor of liberating and devolving economic decision-making to the explicitly self-interested calculations of the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>Today we seem to have all the freedom in the world, we can paint almost anything whenever we want. But this freedom has been gained only by the reduction of society to a grand marketplace. This means that one can paint anything one wants, but the attempt to paint seriously with the ambition of sharing an epic vision with the world and participating publically in an enduring tradition today means to <em>sell</em> paintings. And as Rothko points out, it is one thing for an artist to compete heroically in a battle of wits with a King or Pope who basically and reliably believes in one set of things, but to be subject to multiple, contradictory, fickle, and often mutually-exclusive masters is the definition of castration. For the artist seeking both creative sovereignty and historical transcendence (that is, participation in that aristocracy of spirit the representatives of which have always been the unacknowledged stewards of historical development) all ways seemed blocked under modern capitalism, where cash equivalency and profane circulation reduce the transcendent and the epic to merely subordinate, component parts of capital itself.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Major premodern painters found freedom by circumventing or subverting the wishes of their patrons. Because the classical premodern artist faced a more or less unified set of masters—that is, a fairly unified, coherent social dogma backed by political force and other-worldy hellfire—it was possible to appease them on the surface but outwit them in the final artistic achievement. Today, the situation is fundamentally different. After the death of God, our authority is now the market, a fickle multiplicity of authorities. Mark Rothko writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>In matters of art our society has substituted taste for truth, which she finds more amusing and less of a responsibility, and changers her tastes as frequently as she changes her hats and shoes. And here might the artist, placed between choice and diversity, raise his lamentations louder. Never did his afflictors have as many shapes or such a jabbering of voices, and never did they exude such a prolixity of matter.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means that today we do not even enjoy the conditions for a strategic and subversive compliance. Sheer fantasy is the common justification of collaborationism, that one will placate one or two masters in the short-run in order to circumvent and subvert the rest in the long-run. Rothko continues:</p>

<blockquote><p>For the artist, now, there can be neither compliance nor circumvention. It is the misfortune of free conscience that it cannot be neglectful of means in the pursuit of ends. Ironically enough, compliance would not help, for even if the artist should decide to subvert this conscience, where could he find peace in this Babel? To please one is to antagonize the others. And what security is there in any of these wrangling contenders?</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the reign of the market, which does not even have the formidable, although obviously ideologically mystified dignity of traditional religious grandeur, we do not have the ability to play the classical game of visionary individuals against the grand order, the market being so uncontroversially and transparently superficial, ephemeral, and meaningless.</p>

<p>But as our current situation has in some sense become more drastically and frighteningly hallowed, what we have gained is <em>choice</em>. Under current conditions, all we have is free conscience, a shared knowledge that there are no longer any excuses; no temporary compromises with the enemy can be justified when the enemy itself might, through a shift of taste, change shape tomorrow and leave you humiliated with nothing but your treason. The historical shedding of religious and political mystifications which the market has demanded of its participants has had the effect of peeling away from us everything but our conscience, the basic ability to reflect on ourselves and our position in society, and has brought it to an absolute imperative; for the searching soul, for the artist or the intellectual, our society offers us no viable route to a meaningful life, no anchors, no solidity, modern capitalism conspicuously removing even the very existence of battle lines between creativity and dogmatic power. It is not enough to simply “be creative,” when that is precisely how domination functions via the market, through creation, through the material and symbolic production of a desire that never ceases, never ceases changing form, and never ceases justifying all manner of short-run compromises.</p>

<p>In the elimination of all exit routes, modern capitalism inadvertently accentuates the only thing it must permit to remain. Choice and the right to starve. “The freedom to starve! Ironical indeed. Yet hold your laughter. Do not underestimate the privilege. It is seldom possessed, and dearly won,” writes Rothko. This is all we have, a free conscience, the freedom to make a commitment and starve in executing it. This is too much to bear, you say? We all deserve a modicum of comfort and happiness, a middle-class home and good schools for a troupe of well-fed kids, from which we will nonetheless pursue artistic resistance against a corrupt society? A common position. Following Rothko, however, it has already been explained why for us this route has been foreclosed, why one “one master is better than ten,” and that facing the caprice of the market we may never again “know the size and shape of the hand that holds the whip,” a prerequisite to the compromise-subversion model of classical painters. But better yet, if we take the historical development of Rothko’s painting as an index, there is a sort of geometrical truth in modern painting that delineates at once both the error of many would-be revolutionary artists today and the positive truth or destiny of our contemporary situation.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If we take at their word those who urge interdisciplinarity, there is no reason to stop before even the venerable theory of gravitation—just another partial angle of aristocratic claptrap on the true theory of things.</p>

<p>Newton’s second law suggests that gravitational force equals the product of a body’s mass and its acceleration (F=ma). This implies that any two bodies are attracted to each other by the same force (the gravitational constant), but that the smaller object will accelerate toward the large object much faster than the larger object, why the apple falls toward the Earth rather than vice-versa.</p>

<p>The vocabularies of “random” mutation and “natural” selection incorrectly suggest an equally cosmic indifference at every stage of an evolutionary process. The indifferent cosmos is constantly generating difference, sometimes to integrate it (and thus be indifferent with respect to it), sometimes to be fundamentally altered by it. In other words, things by nature are constantly transcending themselves in random mutation, but each particular mutation has a relationship to the whole population analogous to what one planet in orbit has to the whole population of bodies in space. Specifically, from within any stage of existence, that which exists, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, has a greater <em>mass</em> than new, random mutations.</p>

<p>In Figures 3 and 4, it is easy to see how the present framework can capture relationships of mass, force, and acceleration on the same plane as evolutionary development. The essential point is that in each case it is a matter of relatively weaker things under the pressure of relatively stronger things. Specifically, random mutations of energy are to any stably existing ensemble what an apple is to the Earth, a small thing made to accelerate faster than a larger thing by virtue of a difference in mass. But “small” and “large” are only metaphors, just as “evolutionary fitness” and physical “force” are metaphors. In each case, what is at stake is nothing less than what philosophy and the social sciences will call <em>power</em>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>“It is a tremendous act of violence to begin anything. I am not able to begin. I simply skip what should be the beginning.” – Rainer Maria Rilke</p>

<p>It is only when the mapping animal emerges that distinguishable things emerge, hence a diagrammatic representation of the world of humans includes names. Importantly, names as intensive things occupy the negative space of what is now known as the material object. This is especially important for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, understanding words as occupying the negative (intensive) space of extensive things, and understanding extensive things as the lines of energetic consistency distinguished by names, will account for the surprising and very poorly understood inertia of such apparently epiphenomenal things as words. But secondly, as the diagrams of the present exposition now become “conscious” of themselves, our interpretation shifts somewhat. It is not that suddenly certain creatures called humans go around distinguishing and naming the physical things of the world, as the development of our diagrams cannot avoid implying. Rather, in conceptualizing thinghood as a circular energetic outline, we now <em>realize</em> we have only been drawing lines around the existence of named things. The truth is that chaos, energy without reference, is not composed of things; chaos has no consistency. But to get off the ground, to begin, it is necessary to begin with some-<em>thing</em>. This only refers to the fundamental lie that is the presupposition of the map—that, as Lacan puts it, truth has the structure of a fiction—that the move to the map cannot be mapped once and for all any more than the move off the map, beyond the horizon, can be mapped once and for all.</p>

<p>The violence of beginning that Rilke speaks of is simply the ontological necessity, captured from the beginning of our exposition, that all activity, all becoming of that which is not already, must come from some other thing, some thing that already is. And yet, it is impossible to map the origin because the map itself, which permits us to even imagine the origin, is finite. Thus, Rilke’s formula is perfect: the violence of beginning anything new consists in having to enter the fundamentally dishonest dimension of already existing things. If one pretends to begin anew, one is dissimulating that from which one departs, that which is not new. If one simply “skips the beginning” in all honesty, one dissimulates the reality of having departed from the old. Rilke speaks truthfully at the same time he exonerates himself with a dishonesty all the more insidious for being truthful.</p>

<p>What recommends and justifies the model developed here over many less honest competitors, is that it not only explicitly acknowledges the violence of its beginning but it comprehends and thus accounts for it. That is, for us, the paradox of beginnings is neither a navel-gazing point of interest nor a conundrum. For, we <em>began</em> with the paradox of beginnings as the essential structure of thinghood in general. In our diagram of the thing as having an essentially circular structure, as T.S. Eliot suggests, “the end is where we start from.”</p>

<p>What all of this implies is that every thing, every energetic consistency, is already and necessarily wrapped around the word. Words are things, things are words, and their meaning and behavior are one and the same. This is so plain and simple that it would not even be interesting if its implications, taken seriously and pushed as far as possible, did not open up as many possibilities for the arts and sciences as we will show it capable of opening throughout the rest of this work.</p>

<p>Which came first, object or word? What is the order of their logical priority? These are questions for idiots. It doesn’t matter. Additionally, it is very tempting to specify here a thousand and one distinctions between the word, the letter, the sign, speech, signifier and signified. But these are all distractions, so many little useless toys. Let’s speak simply of the word as placeholder for this whole complex of things associated with human language.</p>

<p>What matters is that we have sketched out the fundamental unity of things extensive and intensive. Furthermore, we have, on a certain wager of naivete, begun to organize into one simplified framework an array of scientific models arbitrarily separated and partialized through the history of an intellectual division labor that has never justified itself intellectually. Before drawing out the full implications of our model of things, let us continue to marshall the full range of perspectives that converge on this general theory of things.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Figure 4 represents the random mutation of what is most commonly thought of as the idea or thought, but which is simply a new thing: the map. The appearance of the “idea” as well as the character of material objectivity are different intensive things modeled on a map-thing. It is easy to see that a map, any map, implies infinity by virtue of the map’s finitude, by virtue of having produced horizons. In a certain register, much has been made of language as a &ldquo;cut.&rdquo; By &ldquo;map&rdquo; we simply mean the more general class of human tools that serve to cut the fabric of materiality with a materiality that produces intensive things. There is now always a beyond of the horizon, a beyond that enlarging the map can never once and for all integrate but only defer. When some thing randomly generates a map and thus bifurcates things into extensive things (referents of the map) and intensive things (relations constructed on or, rather, <em>in</em> the map) it is not as if the evolution of a prior physical and material realm is producing a new realm called the &ldquo;mental&rdquo; realm. The very opposition between mental and physical is only a relation mapped on a plane of immanence. Thus, the map is simply a new thing of a particular character.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>“But an animal does not feign feigning.” – Jacques Lacan, Écrits_ </p>

<p>The <em>human</em> is what emerges when an ensemble randomly generates an <em>idea.</em> An idea is a thing noteworthy only because the idea-thing is not <em>already</em> a thing; it is a lie, a thing supposed into existence precisely because it does not exist, a becoming. An existing ensemble falsely priding itself into a new existence by the false implication that there is some-thing outside of existing. A human emerges when existing things successfully bring into existence a thing that does not physically exist (namely, the “physical world”) by generating another thing that so obviously doesn’t exist (the idea), that by comparison the first thing seems to truly, physically exist. In other words, the human is the animal that produces a plain of immanence as a space of limitless action, an eternal smorgasboard, an all-you-can-eat buffet of nothing, an infinite reservoir of natural gas.</p>

<p>A <em>plain of immanence</em> is the ground of intensive space. In other words, for most intents and purposes, it is the ground of the symbolic dimension, the non-spatial space in which thought takes place and signification is possible. It is not essential to know the answer to such inane questions as when exactly this space opens up or whether dolphins are philosophers no less than humans. It doesn’t matter. It is only for lack of courage,  independence, and material incentives that at this point such complexities would lead many bourgeois political theorists to hesitate and perhaps even abandon ship. The truth is there is no need to be concerned about the thousands of minor curio we could raise about the <em>when</em> and <em>who</em> or even the exact <em>what</em> concerning the precise emergence of conceptual space. All we need to affirm is that it exists, it’s been produced as a thing, an intensive thing that in turn produces other things, and that these things have a nature we are capable of describing and modeling.</p>

<p>The plane of immanence is that ground from which symbols and concepts are spun through intensity rather than extension. Intensive things by their nature have no physical existence: dreams, memories, thoughts, feelings, emotions, all intensive things, which are no less real things for lacking physical existence. Most people incorrectly imagine intensive space to be inside of their heads, but this is obviously wrong. Precisely, <em>intensive space</em> is the negative space of things. Because all things are only variably stable loops of energy, the very nature of things implies or produces a thing other than the thing-in-itself. Although intensive space has no physical existence, it can be mapped. Indeed, the emergence of a plain of immanence in the negative space of the physical thing is the condition for the possibility of mapping. Thus, the best way to think about the plane of immanence is to think of the surfaces associated with artists and intellectuals: paper, canvas, marble, etc. All of these things, in the way that artists and intellectuals employ them, begin as physical things with absolutely zero inherent “meaning” until a human picks them up and uses them to model or map things that then come into a real being no less real on account of its intensiveness.</p>

<p>The plain of immanence is to intensive space what the Earth is to the human bodies living on it: that which permits the possibility of jumping or ascending. Perhaps the best illustration of the plane of immanence is a blank sheet of paper, pressed, flat, physical matter that offers itself to the eye and on which ink can produce something rather than simply spill its own matter. Ink spills on the paper (extensive thing) and it writes on the plane of immanence (ground for the production of intensive things). Although, it should be noted that the plane of immanence is no more an intensive thing than energy itself is a physical thing: both are only theoretical concepts (mapped intensive things) physically made on physical things (symbols, diagrams on paper, etc) as the production of intensive things. The sheet of paper is only a model of the plane of immanence, while the writing as production of intensive things exists only in the intensity of the negative space of physical words, sentences, diagrams,etc.</p>

<p>The human is simply the name of the thing that, when a plane of immanence is randomly generated, dwells inside of it; it is that which literally exists within the negative space of things. The human is its body without organs, the animal that seeks shelter in a cave by becoming an animal that seeks shelter in a cave. </p>

<p>Our philosophical anthropology therefore stumbles like an idiot into one of the only compelling explanation of early cave paintings systematically integrated into a theory of human nature. The animal who draws a buffalo on the inside of a cave is simply doing what they are doing. Artistic genius converges with the sheer uselessness of tautology. In instinct, an unmapped intensity, the animal simply finds shelter or dies. Some find it and live, some fail to find it and die. In the drive, the human version of the instinct, the animal seeks a thing for doing some other thing. That is, it maps the negative space of things (the “meaning” of falling snow, which is that it threatens). It lives if it performs a certain “naturally selected” map of things (walks the line from outside the cave to inside the cave because snow is drawing threatening lines to the ground, and dies if it performs a naturally inopportune map of things (draws a line from itself off a cliff, say). Thus, the human is not so much entering a natural shelter but instead producing shelter as an intensive thing out of a physical thing and climbing inside of it. When it enters the dark cave as the lone animal who lives on a plane of immanence, and for survival must produce maps or models of intensive things, it is actively drawing the animal that draws itself. Why it paints the buffalo requires no solution because there is no problem: it is simply continuing to do what it was already doing and will never stop doing. The real theoretical question is why it will come to paint so rarely.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/06/29/26168279973/" itemprop="url">#4: Natural selection, random mutation, the material world</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The logic of <em>natural selection </em>given <em>random mutuations</em> of ensembles, explains the existence and extinction of ensembles over time. When we conceptualize the circuitry of thinghood according to electrical engineering, we court the error of thinking that energy is something manipulated by the menu of options known to the electrical engineer. Just as Darwin illustrated the theoretical gains to be had by dispensing with God as the designer of everything, we should, for the same reasons, theorize energy as subject to “random mutations.” We will account for the evolution of things by showing that at any point in time, those ensembles that succeed in existing are simply the the random energetic mutations which happen to thrive given the conditions in which they emerge.</p>

<p>Thus, let us consider a simple model of the natural, “material” world. Things are connected to other things in an eco-system of consistencies—a river links to an ocean from which evaporated water links to a sky of clouds from which rain produces the river, and so on—in a more or less stable, circular configuration that perpetuates itself. If the stability of an ensemble is inherently centripetal insofar as it is defined by perpetual orbit around a center of gravity, the notion of random mutation implies a corresponding centrifugal tendency. More rigorously, we should say that existence implies what is known as centripetal force, while change (<em>metabole</em>) implies what is known as centrifugal force. Indeed, the Greek term <em>metabolismos</em> means “outthrow.” The world is simply an ensemble of diverse things characterized by a more or less “hard core” of  well-connected and re-enforcing things nonetheless constantly spinning energy “outward” in random mutation. In the diagram below, the right-most thing in the ensemble represents a random mutation.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6efp2tlmh1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The fate of the random mutation, whether it will be permitted to exist (persist), is soley a function of whether or not it thrives given that which already exists. The integration of a random mutation into a thing that exists over time is thus sheer subordination of a new part to the whole. If a random mutation does not happen to fulfill the strict conditions of what the currently existing ensemble happens to permit, it simply goes away. It goes extinct. We say natural selection implies the subordination of the new part to the whole because mutual-exclusivity of the conditions for existence between a random mutation and the ensemble from which it emerges seems to never result in the larger ensemble going extinct. In any event, the law of the conservation of energy does not imply a law concerning the conservation of things.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/06/10/67/" itemprop="url">Is there really a school-to-prison pipeline?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>1. Can we really say there is a school-to-prison pipeline? And if so, what&rsquo;s &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; it?</strong></p>

<p>The notion of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline">school-to-prison pipeline</a> is increasingly popular in the discourse of a wide coalition of U.S. activists fighting mass incarceration and defending public education. The concept is invoked by groups such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the Justice Policy Center, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Civil_Liberties_Union">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU). Here in Pennsylvania, <a href="http://decarceratepa.info/">DecarceratePA</a> and friends in Occupy Philly invoke this image especially in protest of Governor Corbett&rsquo;s budget priorities, arguing that state spending favors the prison system at the cost of public education.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of this pipeline imagery, it remains only a hypothesis. <a href="http://www.zerotolerancereform.com/wpblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Harvard-Civil-Rights-Project.pdf">Skiba et al. 2003</a> find some evidence that higher school suspension rates are correlated with higher juvenile incarceration rates, but the data is cross-sectional and limited in other ways that preclude confidence in a particular causal story. In a 2009 study, <a href="http://healthpolicy.unm.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Untangling%20the%20School%20Segment%20of%20The%20School-to-Prison%20Pipeline.pdf">Hood and Lopez</a> 2009 find that racial composition of school discipline is not related to the racial composition of juvenile incarceration. In any event, confidence in the argument seems far greater than current research allows, and at worst this could be an erroneous and merely rhetorical hook. Given that the American prison system is probably nothing short of our era&rsquo;s very own<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Crow-Michelle-Alexander/dp/1595586431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337506101&amp;sr=8-1"> Jim Crow</a> regime, the school-to-prison pipeline hypothesis is worth analyzing more scrupulously.</p>

<p><strong>2. A simple model: Is rising inequality &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; resources from education to incarceration?</strong></p>

<p>****The question of whether there is a school-to-prison pipeline begs the question of why there would be a school-to-prison pipeline. Lacking is a specifiable political explanation. One possible explanation is that<em> rising income inequality in the United States encourages policymakers to divert funding from education to incarceration</em>. Why? Classic political economy models of redistribution suggest that as income inequality increases, the median voter increasingly prefers higher taxation and public spending. Because elected policymakers aim to satisfy the pivotal median voter, redistribution should be positively associated with inequality. However, it&rsquo;s also well known that many factors often neutralize or reverse the link between inequality and redistribution. For instance, income inequality can enable the rich to simply capture the government. A combination of these two models can explain how there could be a systematic spending dynamic between education and incarceration. As income inequality increases and the rich gain political power relative to the poor, policymakers have much to gain from the rich, and little to lose from the poor, by cutting taxes and social spending. Although the poor face decreasing political power, we might expect that beyond some threshold, where the poor &ldquo;have nothing to lose but their chains,&rdquo; cuts to essential social services would indeed be severely punished&mdash;by, say, revolutionary upheaval. Therefore, as policymakers cut essential social spending, they should also alter the<em> composition</em> of social spending in a way that also pacifies a rising threat of rebellion.</p>

<p>In summary, perhaps rising income inequality (government capture by the rich and the political alienation of the poor) leads policymakers to divert spending from redistributive programs (public education) to programs of outright and coercive pacification (incarceration), not only further excluding the poor from political participation (the formal disenfranchisement of felons) but also literally, forcibly containing the threat of rebellion against the political system itself.</p>

<p><strong>3. Data</strong></p>

<p>****I&rsquo;ve collected time-series data from the United States for the past 60 years to examine whether there is, or has been, some sort of systematic relationship between education and  incarceration. Most of the data is culled from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/hist_stats.html">Census Bureau historical abstract</a> and usgovernmentspending.com. To extend the Census Bureau historical data past 2001 or so, I do some simple linear interpolations using more up-to-date Census Bureau time series (which go up to 2009 but extend back and overlap the early 2000s cutoff of the historical abstract). In any event, I&rsquo;ve uploaded all of the data to Google Fusion Tables for <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1TsYrSeGBV-mZSvJy0hRRHbUx4aEZoxrZgrymXTI">download</a> lest anyone wants to investigate further. The inequality variable is share of income going to the top 5% percent minus the share of income going to the bottom 5%; education spending per capita is total public spending per capita on elementary, secondary, and tertiary education; the incarceration variable is the number of people incarcerated per 1000 people (interpolated for some years with a slightly different measure, that of the total number under some form of supervision; this is a little awkward but it&rsquo;s a blog post, not a journal article, right?)  The final variables used here are found in the last few columns of the Google Fusion table.</p>

<p>The timespan analyzed here implies a much stronger version of the argument than is popularly articulated: evidence that a school-to-prison pipeline has not existed for several decades would not disprove many more limited versions of the argument. However, evidence of the harder-to-prove, stronger claim of a pipeline dynamic that holds across the past half-century would be even stronger support for today&rsquo;s more limited claims.</p>

The second graph shows that inequality appears to track incarceration.<a href="">/caption</a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>The concept of a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; poses an interesting challenge for how we think about causality and statistical modeling. At a minimum, it seems to imply a negative relationship between two variables, an egress from a source and a flow into a sink, possibly driven by some third quantity representing the pressure or energy pumping the pipeline. There are certainly several ways one could approach modeling such pipeline between education and incarceration, but as a first cut, I test and find some evidence of relationships that together suggest the possibility of something that could reasonably be called a school-to-prison pipeline. The claims are followed by some fairly technical statistical output but with some non-technical notes for interpreting them.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Year-to-year increases in the incarceration rate are correlated with year-to-year decreases in education spending per capita</strong>, even after controlling for economic growth (GDP per capita) and any simple, secular trend over time. A common problem from modeling time-series data is that the variable one wants to explain is often so much a function of its previous years&#8217; values that it&rsquo;s easy to find spurious relationships with other explanatory variables. So all of the models below include a combination of lagged dependent variables or transformed variables (and pass traditional tests of significant serial correlation in the dependent variable).</li>
</ol>


<p>2. <strong>Year-to year increases in inequality are also correlated with year-to-year decreases in education spending per capita, a</strong><strong>lthough it is not clear if inequality itself correlates with decreases in education spending beyond its correlation with the incarceration rate. </strong>This is because when both inequality and incarceration rates are included in the same model (not displayed), Inequality drops out of statistical significance and Incarceration_Rate remains significant. It&rsquo;s possible that both have independent and separate negative effects on education spending but a full model can&rsquo;t sort out independent effects from two explanatory variables that are themselves highly correlated (high collinearity). Nonetheless, changes in the incarceration rate seem directly correlated with decreases in education spending. Inequality may or may not</p>

<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-56-29-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>If rising inequality is the pump of the pipeline, it would make sense that inequality itself is not directly, independently correlated with education spending. If increases in incarceration are associated with decreases in education, the model sketched above suggests rising inequality might very well explain most directly changes in the incarceration rate.  <strong>Inequality is positively associated with increased incarceration, controlling for the crime rate, previous incarceration rates, and secular trend. </strong>This is true whether or not one looks at levels or year-to-year changes. The interaction of crime and inequality (crime rate multiplied by inequality) also appears to have a systematic relationship to the incarceration rate, suggesting that neither inequality nor crime alone drive incarceration but that perhaps crime is a trigger for incarceration that is conditional on the degree of inequality&mdash;also consistent with the model sketched above.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-57-01-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Conservatives might claim that the notion of a school-to-prison pipeline is a misleading interpretation of the culture of poverty, in which the poor are thought to simply opt for crime over educational aspirations, requiring greater incarceration and less spending on education, which in turn leads the rich to get richer compared to an increasingly incarcerated poor. But there&rsquo;s no evidence for these claims: when all these variables are considered in one system of equations (vector autoregression or VAR), effectively allowing each to cause each controlling for the effects of the others, <strong>there remains evidence that inequality drives the incarceration rate and no evidence that crime or incarceration is driving inequality.</strong> It could be that crime and incarceration have an immediate effect on inequality or are highly collinear, and that either of these facts make its effect on inequality statistically indistinguishable&mdash;and for this reason it&rsquo;s no surprise the relationship between incarceration and education spending drops out&mdash;the key point of the table below is simply that inequality&rsquo;s effect on incarceration is robust against the conservative arguments to the effect that inequality is a fair outcome rather than a driver of unfair outcomes.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-57-24-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Below are overlaid impulse-response functions. The first graph displays the predicted effect that some exogenous shock on inequality has on education spending, compared to its effect on the incarceration rate. Moving from left to right across the x-axis charts the decay of the effect over time. Of course, this assumes that our VAR was a fully and correctly specified model, which is unlikely. Nonetheless, as a back of the e-napkin analysis, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that an exogenous shock to inequality has a positive and statistically significant effect on incarceration.</p>

<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/irf_inequality_education_prison.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second graph shows that an exogenous shock to inequality has a far larger effect on the incarceration rate than an exogenous shock to the crime rate.</p>
