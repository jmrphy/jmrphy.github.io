	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>1. Can we really say there is a school-to-prison pipeline? And if so, what&rsquo;s &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; it?</strong></p>

<p>The notion of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline">school-to-prison pipeline</a> is increasingly popular in the discourse of a wide coalition of U.S. activists fighting mass incarceration and defending public education. The concept is invoked by groups such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the Justice Policy Center, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Civil_Liberties_Union">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU). Here in Pennsylvania, <a href="http://decarceratepa.info/">DecarceratePA</a> and friends in Occupy Philly invoke this image especially in protest of Governor Corbett&rsquo;s budget priorities, arguing that state spending favors the prison system at the cost of public education.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of this pipeline imagery, it remains only a hypothesis. <a href="http://www.zerotolerancereform.com/wpblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Harvard-Civil-Rights-Project.pdf">Skiba et al. 2003</a> find some evidence that higher school suspension rates are correlated with higher juvenile incarceration rates, but the data is cross-sectional and limited in other ways that preclude confidence in a particular causal story. In a 2009 study, <a href="http://healthpolicy.unm.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Untangling%20the%20School%20Segment%20of%20The%20School-to-Prison%20Pipeline.pdf">Hood and Lopez</a> 2009 find that racial composition of school discipline is not related to the racial composition of juvenile incarceration. In any event, confidence in the argument seems far greater than current research allows, and at worst this could be an erroneous and merely rhetorical hook. Given that the American prison system is probably nothing short of our era&rsquo;s very own<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Crow-Michelle-Alexander/dp/1595586431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337506101&amp;sr=8-1"> Jim Crow</a> regime, the school-to-prison pipeline hypothesis is worth analyzing more scrupulously.</p>

<p><strong>2. A simple model: Is rising inequality &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; resources from education to incarceration?</strong></p>

<p>****The question of whether there is a school-to-prison pipeline begs the question of why there would be a school-to-prison pipeline. Lacking is a specifiable political explanation. One possible explanation is that<em> rising income inequality in the United States encourages policymakers to divert funding from education to incarceration</em>. Why? Classic political economy models of redistribution suggest that as income inequality increases, the median voter increasingly prefers higher taxation and public spending. Because elected policymakers aim to satisfy the pivotal median voter, redistribution should be positively associated with inequality. However, it&rsquo;s also well known that many factors often neutralize or reverse the link between inequality and redistribution. For instance, income inequality can enable the rich to simply capture the government. A combination of these two models can explain how there could be a systematic spending dynamic between education and incarceration. As income inequality increases and the rich gain political power relative to the poor, policymakers have much to gain from the rich, and little to lose from the poor, by cutting taxes and social spending. Although the poor face decreasing political power, we might expect that beyond some threshold, where the poor &ldquo;have nothing to lose but their chains,&rdquo; cuts to essential social services would indeed be severely punished&mdash;by, say, revolutionary upheaval. Therefore, as policymakers cut essential social spending, they should also alter the<em> composition</em> of social spending in a way that also pacifies a rising threat of rebellion.</p>

<p>In summary, perhaps rising income inequality (government capture by the rich and the political alienation of the poor) leads policymakers to divert spending from redistributive programs (public education) to programs of outright and coercive pacification (incarceration), not only further excluding the poor from political participation (the formal disenfranchisement of felons) but also literally, forcibly containing the threat of rebellion against the political system itself.</p>

<p><strong>3. Data</strong></p>

<p>****I&rsquo;ve collected time-series data from the United States for the past 60 years to examine whether there is, or has been, some sort of systematic relationship between education and  incarceration. Most of the data is culled from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/hist_stats.html">Census Bureau historical abstract</a> and usgovernmentspending.com. To extend the Census Bureau historical data past 2001 or so, I do some simple linear interpolations using more up-to-date Census Bureau time series (which go up to 2009 but extend back and overlap the early 2000s cutoff of the historical abstract). In any event, I&rsquo;ve uploaded all of the data to Google Fusion Tables for <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1TsYrSeGBV-mZSvJy0hRRHbUx4aEZoxrZgrymXTI">download</a> lest anyone wants to investigate further. The inequality variable is share of income going to the top 5% percent minus the share of income going to the bottom 5%; education spending per capita is total public spending per capita on elementary, secondary, and tertiary education; the incarceration variable is the number of people incarcerated per 1000 people (interpolated for some years with a slightly different measure, that of the total number under some form of supervision; this is a little awkward but it&rsquo;s a blog post, not a journal article, right?)  The final variables used here are found in the last few columns of the Google Fusion table.</p>

<p>The timespan analyzed here implies a much stronger version of the argument than is popularly articulated: evidence that a school-to-prison pipeline has not existed for several decades would not disprove many more limited versions of the argument. However, evidence of the harder-to-prove, stronger claim of a pipeline dynamic that holds across the past half-century would be even stronger support for today&rsquo;s more limited claims.</p>

The second graph shows that inequality appears to track incarceration.<a href="">/caption</a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>The concept of a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; poses an interesting challenge for how we think about causality and statistical modeling. At a minimum, it seems to imply a negative relationship between two variables, an egress from a source and a flow into a sink, possibly driven by some third quantity representing the pressure or energy pumping the pipeline. There are certainly several ways one could approach modeling such pipeline between education and incarceration, but as a first cut, I test and find some evidence of relationships that together suggest the possibility of something that could reasonably be called a school-to-prison pipeline. The claims are followed by some fairly technical statistical output but with some non-technical notes for interpreting them.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Year-to-year increases in the incarceration rate are correlated with year-to-year decreases in education spending per capita</strong>, even after controlling for economic growth (GDP per capita) and any simple, secular trend over time. A common problem from modeling time-series data is that the variable one wants to explain is often so much a function of its previous years&#8217; values that it&rsquo;s easy to find spurious relationships with other explanatory variables. So all of the models below include a combination of lagged dependent variables or transformed variables (and pass traditional tests of significant serial correlation in the dependent variable).</li>
</ol>


<p>2. <strong>Year-to year increases in inequality are also correlated with year-to-year decreases in education spending per capita, a</strong><strong>lthough it is not clear if inequality itself correlates with decreases in education spending beyond its correlation with the incarceration rate. </strong>This is because when both inequality and incarceration rates are included in the same model (not displayed), Inequality drops out of statistical significance and Incarceration_Rate remains significant. It&rsquo;s possible that both have independent and separate negative effects on education spending but a full model can&rsquo;t sort out independent effects from two explanatory variables that are themselves highly correlated (high collinearity). Nonetheless, changes in the incarceration rate seem directly correlated with decreases in education spending. Inequality may or may not</p>

<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-56-29-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>If rising inequality is the pump of the pipeline, it would make sense that inequality itself is not directly, independently correlated with education spending. If increases in incarceration are associated with decreases in education, the model sketched above suggests rising inequality might very well explain most directly changes in the incarceration rate.  <strong>Inequality is positively associated with increased incarceration, controlling for the crime rate, previous incarceration rates, and secular trend. </strong>This is true whether or not one looks at levels or year-to-year changes. The interaction of crime and inequality (crime rate multiplied by inequality) also appears to have a systematic relationship to the incarceration rate, suggesting that neither inequality nor crime alone drive incarceration but that perhaps crime is a trigger for incarceration that is conditional on the degree of inequality&mdash;also consistent with the model sketched above.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-57-01-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Conservatives might claim that the notion of a school-to-prison pipeline is a misleading interpretation of the culture of poverty, in which the poor are thought to simply opt for crime over educational aspirations, requiring greater incarceration and less spending on education, which in turn leads the rich to get richer compared to an increasingly incarcerated poor. But there&rsquo;s no evidence for these claims: when all these variables are considered in one system of equations (vector autoregression or VAR), effectively allowing each to cause each controlling for the effects of the others, <strong>there remains evidence that inequality drives the incarceration rate and no evidence that crime or incarceration is driving inequality.</strong> It could be that crime and incarceration have an immediate effect on inequality or are highly collinear, and that either of these facts make its effect on inequality statistically indistinguishable&mdash;and for this reason it&rsquo;s no surprise the relationship between incarceration and education spending drops out&mdash;the key point of the table below is simply that inequality&rsquo;s effect on incarceration is robust against the conservative arguments to the effect that inequality is a fair outcome rather than a driver of unfair outcomes.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-06-01-at-2-57-24-pm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Below are overlaid impulse-response functions. The first graph displays the predicted effect that some exogenous shock on inequality has on education spending, compared to its effect on the incarceration rate. Moving from left to right across the x-axis charts the decay of the effect over time. Of course, this assumes that our VAR was a fully and correctly specified model, which is unlikely. Nonetheless, as a back of the e-napkin analysis, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that an exogenous shock to inequality has a positive and statistically significant effect on incarceration.</p>

<p><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/irf_inequality_education_prison.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second graph shows that an exogenous shock to inequality has a far larger effect on the incarceration rate than an exogenous shock to the crime rate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It suffices to point out for this first exposition of the model that reciprocity is an essential requirement of the relations among any and all sub-things which we will understand as composing an ensemble. However, the concept of reciprocity only represents the formal essence of another concept that has become at once a ubiquitious but diversely-employed and contested concept across the human sciences. What is here defined as reciprocity is the essential relationship that modern economics knows as <em>investment<strong>.</strong></em> If an investor invests in some new enterprise, the lender and borrower do not compose a durable ensemble of things unless the borrower earns enough money to at least pay the lender back. If the borrower doesn’t pay the lender back then there remains only a borrower and an insolvent, disappearing lender. </p>

<p>The connection to economics is only worth mentioning so early in the exposition because it will be highly significant later that one of the most simple relations between things is captured with such theoretical sophistication in modern economic theory. As Marx points out, for the sake of efficiency modern capitalism hardly hides its processes. Because it lays bare the motion of society so frankly, its laws become a wealth of insights into even pre-capitalist formations. Thus, none of this should be taken as implying “economic reductionism,” but rather quite the opposite. The modern economic conception of investment is only a very partial, ideological rendition of the basic—and much more parsimonious—pre-“economic” insight into a formal requirement of things in general, economic or otherwise. Namely, that for two things to endure as a system with only one supply of energy, any transfer of energy from one thing to the other must find a return route. Later in this work, it will become clear that <em>capitalism</em> is simply one historically specific but highly evolved and integrated organization of hierarchical institutions the essential characteristic of which is that it makes possible <em>infinite deferrals of true reciprocity</em> via ceaseless forms of leveraged investments.</p>

<p>Thus far, we have presupposed nothing concerning why, how, or when things plug into one another. The goal has been only to establish a parsimonious framework for theorizing the existence of things in a language that is at once deeply intuitive and draws credence from being at the intersection of several fields of knowledge. But why should we expect things to have plugged into one another in the ways that they have in the course of natural history? In other words, what does the framework developed here offer in the philosophically and/or scientifically rigorous study of the world?</p>

<p>We are now in a position to show that the framework developed here, almost childish in its return to the most basic premises because it synthesizes such basic lessons from diverse disciplines—enables a surprisingly simple yet potent set of deductions for explaining rather than just describing the nature of things.</p>

<p>At any point in time, what we call the <em>world</em> is only the sum of all things. A diagrammatic image of the world would depict so many things within variable ensembles. By pursuing implications already contained in our exposition so far, it is possible to understand how and why, historically, things have plugged into each other in certain ways. If physics, geometry, and electrical analysis are all so many partial angles on the essential nature of things, the modern theory of evolution is only one more.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>But where does the energy within a thing come from? Of course, in the human study of proximate causes, energy always comes from some other thing, a battery, for instance. It is well known that the search for original causes quickly encounters philosophical and historical conundrums that have never been satisfactorily overcome. Thus, as far as we know, all things derive their energy from something else, some sort of source or proximate cause. We will return to the question of origins later, but for the world of things that can be studied, every thing is in some way plugged into some other thing. Humans get their energy from food, food gets its energy from the sun, the sun was generated by larger cosmic forces, and it&rsquo;s simply not necessary to know where everything began to know that all things get their energy from some other thing. Depending on whether the perspective is from the giving or receiving thing, we will follow analysts of elecricity and name the point of connection between things <em>sink</em> or <em>source</em>, respectively. Once energy comes into a thing and supplies energy for its thinghood, electrical engineers teach us that any number of other things can be plugged into the first thing. If a new thing is plugged into a circuit, there are now simply two things composing one thing larger than the first thing by itself. </p>

<p>But to speak of “plugging” a new thing into the circuit of another thing, as a second lightbulb can be plugged into the circuit previously only running one lightbulb, is only a metaphor, already too specific and historically advanced to be justified as the exact model. It presupposes too much, for instance, that a thing can already exist before it&rsquo;s plugged into something else. A lightbulb is itself only produced by humans plugging hundreds of things into each other in a particular production process. So really what we need to understand are the conditions for the very possibility of plugging things into one another. In other words, how do things produce other things before it is possible to speak of “plugging?” </p>

<p>The study of natural systems suggests that things are constantly sending energy off of their own circuits, throwing it into the milieu of some other thing(s), sometimes dissipating, but sometimes powering some other thing. To pursue the intimations of our definitions, when a thing sends off energy out of its specific thinghood and thereby sends energy into some other thing(s) that channel it, stabilize, and circulate it in a new, more or less distinguishable configuration we might say that it simply <em>produces</em> a new thing. Because energy can be neither created nor destroyed, anytime a thing sends off energy, in a sense, it will be going somewhere, into some thing. So energy is inherently always producing, it is only a matter of what thing(s) it is producing. When a volcano erupts, the energy is seemingly more destructive than “productive,” but it is clear that the natural system of which it is a part reabsorb these energies and they function in its system. Thus, this is the circulation of energy within a certain ensemble of things, which we are capable of distinguishing into so many sub-things and sub-sub-things (the whole eco-system, the volcano, the magma, etc.) On the other hand, energies thrown out by one thing sometimes produce qualitatively new things, for instance, the production of organic matter from inorganic matter, or the engineered steering of steam into moving locomotives.</p>

<p>Thus, there are things and then there are things producing other things. Let us call <em>ensemble </em>any thing composed of more than one thing. This term emphasizes the open-endedness with which things can be composed of other things; there are no <em>a priori</em> reasons for defining in advance how many things can be plugged into how many things, and neither are there reasons for saying much about how things plug. It is enough just to establish that things plug into other things. Schematic of the simple, minimal ensemble:<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dflxCory1qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The diagramatic representation of the ensemble focuses attention on an interesting feature of any existing ensemble. For an ensemble to persist, it would not be enough for a thing simply to send off energy somewhere. If a thing plugs into some other thing without the second thing plugging back into the first, without a plug in return, if the first thing diverts outside of itself previously-looping energy by a tangent, this implies the end of its own positive feedback. In such a situation, there would be no ensemble but rather a process of <em>transformation</em>. One thing would become a new thing, but that is all. Genuine transformation is genuine <em>creativity</em>, as we will see. The tangential offshoot of energy represented in the upper curved line of figure two illustrates that the new thing would receive all of the energy in the first thing; and as a result the first thing would simply lose its consistency as a thing. The second thing’s internal consistency or loop would absorb all of the first thing’s energy into its own loop if there were not a reciprocal tangential offshoot (the lower curved line) of energy back to the first thing. Thus, we say that for an ensemble to be a stable thing consisting of and constituted by sub-things, it is necessary for one sub-thing to plug into the second sub-thing and vice-versa. When two or more things each plug into one another, creating an ensemble, we say that their relationship is one of <em>reciprocity</em>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If we try to work from the most basic and uncontroversial terms, we might call by the name of <em>energy</em> (ἐνέργεια, “activity, operation”<strong>) t</strong>hat universal polymorphous lust that constitutes <em>things</em>. The universe is undeniably constituted and constituting, operating, and energy seems to be the best available term that accounts for it as a whole.</p>

<p>The term “energy” is not itself a thing or thing-in-itself (<em>noumenon</em>) because, according to classical physics, it is only indirectly observable, it exists only theoretically, abstractly deduced from observation. Because energy is also classically understood as a physical system&rsquo;s capacity to do work on another system, it seems much like the <em>line segment</em> in traditional Euclidean geometry. Like energy, the line is not a thing-in-itself, but a purely theoretical abstraction defined by Euclid as “breathless length.” A line segment is defined as a line bound by two endpoints, just as energy transfering between two systems similarly traverses a sort of breathless length from one point to another.</p>

<p>(Like all thinking that issues from a particular configuration of things rather than the theory of all things, these disciplines of knowledge are only partial angles in partial registers the partiality of which is specifically a function of the unquestioned <em>things</em> that are the condition for their theoretical development. This is to be explained later, but its mention in advance is perhaps necessary to assuage the anxiety of any institutionalized thought which, also a function of things rather than necessary truths, will be inclined to dismiss the present exposition as naïve or childish. Of course, it is both, but for good reasons.)</p>

<p>Energy within a system constitutes a <em>thing</em>. If there was no energy in a system, it would be <em>no-thing</em>. This is illustrated quite nicely by the philosophers of electricity, who argue that line means <em>circuit</em>, or in other words, a closed loop. Thus, we might reasonably define <strong>things</strong> as closed loops of variable energy. Diagrammatically, this implies a line segment that is curved rather than straight, and which loops back into itself.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m583wx9ZC51qz9517.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This definition of the thing presents a concise model of the most basic and distinguishing characteristic of thinghood, that a thing <em>is</em>, that it exists, that it sustains a certain circulation of energy in a more or less stable form for whatever period of time.</p>

<p>Hat tip goes to <a href="http://rhls.com/about.html">Ruffeo Hearts Lil Snotty</a>, from whom I got the pattern <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGsQFjAA&amp;url=http://www.rhls.com/threadbanger/fannypack.pdf&amp;ei=iXnCT5KCFujG6AGeipSuCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyjzo-g5BE7flpB1rrY43PpfcfmA&amp;sig2=UJOrPRPgYAtdA_T6Q0gC4Q">here</a>. As a business their politics and aesthetics are not quite mine&mdash;ultimately they do seem to be selling the false freedoms of frivolity, nostalgia, and the possibility of an ethical life under contemporary capitalism&mdash;but as humans they seem pretty rad (anti-exploitation, &ldquo;anti-fashion&rdquo;, DIY, they closed down for May Day, etc.). Taking some liberties with the design and having neither a shred of experience nor skill in sewing, I feel like my version is sufficiently DIY-looking to at least signal a theoretical rejection of the status quo. Surveying my career as a fashion designer, I feel like my intention over the past six days or so has been to blend the prevailing hipster aesthetic with the, uh, &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; or something. I think by &ldquo;militant anticapitalist aesthetic&rdquo; I mean militant anticapitalist &ldquo;colors&rdquo; and &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; maybe.</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a fucking mess of goddam strings sticking out of every nook and crevice in the bloody thing but I feel like that is just my signature style as a fashion designer. Everything I make will just have a million goddamn strings sticking out of every bloody fold and cranny, not on purpose but because that&rsquo;s just my style or something, i.e. what happened this time and will probably keep happening because I feel no desire to learn how to avoid that happening. I can&rsquo;t believe sewing works considering it&rsquo;s just a million little idiotic strings going every which way. Of course that works, so obvious.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made of standard canvas from a bookbag, which I lined with vinyl to make it uh, possibly water resistant. Incidentally, the vinyl came from the Occupy Philly May Day &ldquo;STRIKE&rdquo; banner! It has belt loops in the back to string my belt through. I added a little D-ring, why? Fuck if I know!l Looks useful, why the fuck not? So easy, should have added a goddamn can opener while I was at it. I also threw in a few pencil holders, a little pouch on the inside, and a red square for the historically unprecedented, spontaneous, indefinite <em>manifestations</em> of hundreds of thousands of Québécois underway right now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start learning how to scrape/analyze data from the Twitter API. Starting with pretty simple stuff, I used the TwitteR package in R to scrape almost all of the tweets by both U.S.presidential nominees. It&rsquo;s only possible to download 3200 tweets at a time, but this accounts for most of Obama&rsquo;s tweets (4,016 at the time of writing this) and all of Romney&rsquo;s (953).</p>

<p>One question we can ask is whether either nominee tweets lengthier tweets than the other. We know that G.W. Bush cultivated a populist sort of anti-intellectual style of speaking, we think of McCain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Straight Talk Express&rdquo; bus tour, and of course Obama is often characterized as an academic elite.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rplot3.jpg"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rplot3.jpg?w=470" alt="Image" /></a></p>

<p>Interestingly, although the modal length of tweets for both candidates is around the maximum of 140, @MittRomney spikes a little bit around 50 characters. It&rsquo;s impossible to say from this little graphic whether this difference reveals something systematic, but maybe the spike of roughly 50-character tweets from @MittRomney reflects a more &ldquo;straight talking&rdquo; tweeter than @BarackObama?</p>

<p>I know a young woman of color who works at Whole Foods and she once told me there would never be a strike there. When I asked her why, she said it would never happen there because none of the workers would ever believe that it could actually be possible there.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>A middle-aged white man, a corrections officer at the local jail, is using sophisticated biometric technology to scan my hand from a thousand different angles, thanking us for doing what we’re doing, then telling his co-worker how he’d rather be at home with his kids, playing video games and “shooting shit.”</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>I enter a bar in a bourgeois part of town to visit my close friend who is bartending. I sit down, alone, and wait for my friend to notice me. To my right is a skinny, pale, dirty-blonde older man a little taller than myself but slouched, elbows on the bar. He says something to me, slurring, I forget what. One of the bartenders, not my friend, sets in front of the man a plate: steak, a small arugula salad, and french fries with some bullshit aoli or whatever the fuck. My friend is busy so the man and I get to talking. His name is Shawn and he works for a life insurance company.</p>

<p>“Great job,” he says, “It’s really fascinating, the way money works and living and dying and
everything work together, pretty crazy.”
“Yea, that is crazy,” I say, “You an Irish guy?”
“Yea,” he says, “you?”
“Yea,” I say.
“County Mayo, he says.
“Armagh,” I say. “Sometimes I think about moving there. It would probably feel authentic and self-righteous to live somewhere where I could feel like a legitimate member of the colonized rather than the colonizing.”</p>

<p>At that moment, the local news on the bar’s television ran a feature on the big protests that took place downtown earlier in the day. He could tell I had just come from downtown.</p>

<p>“Protesting never works, you need pipebombs, that’s what the Irish would do,” he informed me. He also offered me the rest of his food. Yes, of course, I’ll eat the rest of your food. I hate most Irish-Americans.
“I used to be like you, I am like you, I’m a marxist,” he informs me. He also bought me a beer.</p>

<p>“It’s never going to work, kid, I’m telling you. Just look at me…”
I just continue eating his scraps, take a sip of beer, and smile.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>“Look, you can’t change the world, you just can’t. Things have evolved how they’ve evolved for reasons, you can try to change things but you can’t change the reasons they are like they are so you can’t just stop the world from being like it is,” he said. He’s about eight years older than me, a goofy, friendly, funny white guy who likes comic books.</p>

<p>“No,” I told him, “Things are how they are because people like you make always make <em>that</em> argument. I don’t care if I’m naive or unrealistic, I have a right to be naive and unrealistic. And I actually believe its our obligation regardless of how practical it seems.”</p>

<p>“Wait until you’re my age, you’ll see… I used to think the same things you think. And people older than me used to tell me I would give it up eventually and back then I would insist that I was never going to give in…” He had tears in his eyes.
“And you did,” I said.
“And I did,” he said.
“Well you make your own choices and I respect that,” I said. But did you ever think that, at the very least, you owe it to us, to me and my generation and everyone else who hasn’t caved yet, to maybe atone for your own faithlessness, to at least refrain from deflating us? You are clearly disappointed in yourself and I would never rub salt in your wounds, as long as you don’t soothe your wounds by sapping our strength. We can change everything, if people like you would just shut the fuck up and give us even the most passive support rather than running your dead mouths. Have you ever considered the possibility that the only reason this awful world continues is because older people will say anything to forestall coming to terms with how they betrayed themselves?”</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h2>The neurotic repetitions in public opinion against Occupy</h2>

<p>Revolution is the radical demystification of desire beyond demand; conservatism is the mystification of desire by its reduction to demand.</p>

<p>Media spokespeople, critics on the right, and even sympathetic but timid bourgeois progressives everywhere will not cease clamoring, in so many obviously trembling equivalences: “Eventually, you’ll have to, sooner or later, focus, articulate demands, we understand your rage, but eventually, you’ll have to narrow the issues, what exactly do you want?” And so on and so forth. Of course, what is too frightening for most observers and the mainstream media to say aloud if they are even able to comprehend it is a certain realization that is increasingly obvious to many of us on the ground: that everyday more and more of us lose even the idea that we might ever again want something from the political system. Many of us, over the past few months, have simply lost the capacity to be delightfully charmed by the idea of anyone giving us anything.</p>

<p>Historically, the relative few in positions of power have had centuries to give the less powerful multitude what they want but, needless to say, those with power only ever concede the bare minimum required for the multitude to cooperate. The multitude has been asking for more since time immemorial, while every now and then some people get clever enough to try and take it, usually through centralized models such as building union power or skipping right to clandestine vanguards. Today, the arrogance and ignorance of the wealthy will be their downfall because now we’re just saying in all seriousness that the 99% should just take what they want, together and openly. And the reality is that when one has learned to take, asking becomes absurd. This logic is obvious enough, and its revolutionary significance explains the neurotic repetitions we hear over and over again. “Uh, eventually, sooner or later, you’ll need to make demands, uh&hellip; please,? please, please!” In fact, an expression such as “narrow down the issues” is a rather hilariously transparent euphemism, quite close to a good-old fashioned Freudian slip, for “please make your movement smaller and weaker.”</p>

<p>These neurotic repetitions from those who sit comfortably in the status quo not only serve to dissimulate and discredit the truth and reality of the revolutionary preference for taking over asking, a conversion of consciousness by which many of us on the ground are obviously being carried away. They are additionally symptomatic of a truly stunning repression of historical memory. Even many sympathetic progressive folks, if they sit comfortably in the status quo, will insist in all honesty that for strategic purposes we have to focus on specific demands. They are truly textbook neurotics insofar as their repetitions are symptoms of the repressed memory that the latest and greatest examples of the most powerfully revolutionary movements have been wildly unfocused, non-specific, and non-demanding. The first fact is that the only time we’ve approached genuine, democratic, non-authoritarian revolution in a postwar “liberal democracy” (France in 1968) has been through a social movement of unfocusing organization, proliferating rather than narrowing the issues, refusing to make demands, and the contagious occupation of physical spaces. The second fact is that this most genuine revolutionary surge of militant democracy was betrayed, defused, and thwarted precisely by a hierarchical reimposition of organizational focus by the unions and parties, a narrowing of issues, the making of demands, and exactly at the cost of, in a direct negotiated trade for, the end of occupations.</p>

<p>A theoretically and empirically rigorous analysis could show that these neurotic repetition compulsions against us, which we find across the board of bourgeois American opinion, are better interpreted as evidence that mass occupation and the refusal to make demands are indeed exactly the right approach. We must learn to interpret the pronouncements of status quo figures not as thermometers of contemporary feeling but as all the more convincing negative indicators of the true contemporary feeling, just as Freud interprets the neurotic who swears their dream is not about their mother…</p>
