	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In the Golden Age of ancient Greece, the elite cultivated an intellectual and political disalienation which today we can hardly fathom. But that was for a very small few whose leisure was directly and overwhelmingly based on the enslavement of others. At times I wonder if the magic of capitalist social relations is to effectively put a freeze on human freedom such that it only allows a constant quantity at any particular time; if you only give it to 500 people on the planet then they&rsquo;ll be really really free but when it is distributed to the masses (in order to expand and enhance the planet&rsquo;s labor power beyond chattel slavery), then everyone is only slightly free. What is interesting about capitalism is that the bourgeoisie so loves the pursuit of wealth that they have enslaved themselves, working extraordinarily long hours and obsessively doing the increasingly hard work of making capitalism hang together. The more people working in a given society, the rich included, the more freedom there is to be had by those who produce and reproduce life outside of commodified work. It is therefore an inherently revolutionary tendency that the most powerful individuals of the status quo are perpetually exhausting and blinding themselves by their own overworking&hellip;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>To take these introductory comments seriously is to unlock a whole new orientation for scientific research never before accessed by serious institutionalized scientific disciplines, especially the currently prevailing sciences of society. This present work is in no sense “interdisciplinary.” Rather, it is militantly anti-disciplinary, anti-<em>discipline </em>for that matter, and by scientific necessity. Moreover, what is at stake in this pursuit is a practical project of reconstituting that chain of speech, truth, and being—a chain of which Socrates is perhaps only the purest representative—which is the key to the history and fall of critical thought. Consequently, this work cannot be anything other than a gift in the strict sense, an expenditure without reserve, in friendship with the friendless, and an opening salvo against all the intellectual moneychangers, against all false friends everywhere. As such, it is also a call to philosophic and scientific arms, directed first and foremost to my peers, the young and privileged and educated, we who still have a choice between producing false truths to earn petty comforts in a thoroughly false society, or defecting in favor of a radically emancipated honesty absolutely opposed to every currently existing institution. Needless to say, the latter course won’t pay because it is strictly priceless or, what is the same, <em>worthless</em>. The only personal rewards we can expect are the clarity and dignity of poverty, and if we make it, an actual intellectual community. It’s happened once or twice before. But it is only by betraying the betrayers that we might one day soon meet on such a plane of new beginnings, the plane of honest philosophy and honest science.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><a href="http://redonkulusblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/could-fed-save-obama.html">Redonkulus Blog thinks so</a> based on some time-series data. But I was skeptical about this conclusions because I have just enough experience with time series to know that these sorts of inferences are really tricky. After checking out the data, I don&rsquo;t think there is a systematic relationship between inflation expectations and Obama&rsquo;s re-election prospects. For an overview of the measures, just visit the link above&hellip; I only want to share some analyses and review what&rsquo;s methodologically at stake here.</p>

<p>In short, the problem with time-series data is that it&rsquo;s often autocorrelated&mdash;for instance, an observation at time T-1 has a very strong effect on that variable at time T. When regressing a time series on another time series, it&rsquo;s easy to identify statistically significant relationships where no such thing exists if one variable is driving itself while another variable is just going along for the ride over time.</p>

<p>In regression analysis, the easiest way to check against spurious relationships is to analyze the residuals of the model. In particular, a plot of the model residuals against fitted values should be random with no identifiable pattern&mdash;if there are identifiable patterns than the model probably violated assumptions and is no good.</p>

<p>All of the Redonkulus regressions show residuals that suggest problematic models. I&rsquo;ll focus only on the inflation expectations model because that&rsquo;s what piqued some twitter interest heh.</p>

<p>Here are graphs of the model relating inflation expectations to Obama&rsquo;s Intrade scores. We see a pretty systematic pattern in the residuals by fitted values plot, suggesting violations of the OLS assumptions.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflationresiduals.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflationresiduals.png" alt="" /></a>One simple way to deal with this is to transform the time series in a way that filters out the autoregression. One way to do that is to use first differences instead of simple levels. Intuitively, this is perhaps more attractive, anyway: If we think X causes Y, then really we should think that a change in X will be associated with a change in Y&mdash;not just that when one is high the other is high.</p>

<p>Differencing and then re-running the model gives pretty clean, white-noise-ish residuals. But the relationship is not statistically significant.</p>

<p><strong>                                       Estimate    Std. Error    t value    Pr(>|t|)</strong>
(Intercept)                    0.313765      0.164460         1.908      0.0593
D.inflex                         -0.986283   2.377463         -0.415      0.6791
obama$Time<a href="">-105</a>     -0.005026   0.002742        -1.833      0.0698</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/diffinflationresiduals1.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/diffinflationresiduals1.png" alt="" /></a>And I basically find the same thing for the other models&mdash;residuals show violation of OLS assumptions; models using first differences are statistically insignificant but the residuals look pretty clean. I even tried lags on the independent variables, thinking maybe changes in inflation expectations might just take a day to show up in Obama&rsquo;s Intrade chances&mdash;but no, nothing. A scatterplot using levels and then a scatterplot using first differences sums this up.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflscatter.png"><img src="http://justinmurphy.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/inflscatter.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In summary, I don&rsquo;t think this data offers evidence that monetary expansion would help Obama&rsquo;s chances of re-election. All of my R code follows, email me or Redonkulous if you want the data file.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>“Whatever needs to be maintained through force is doomed.” – Henry Miller</p>

<p>The political implications at this point in our exposition are an almost absurd combination of obvious and radical. The most important implication of the present framework is that it unites the aim of social science (demonstrable causal explanations of empirical phenomena) with the aim of political philosophy (demonstrable explanations of what is good or just). This is because everything indicates that the concept of equilibrium in scientific modeling has more than an etymological commonality with the concept of <em>equality</em> in political philosophy. The philosophical value of equality has little to do with any historical state of nature, any original situation, or any traditionally positive, “true” philosophy of human nature whatsoever. As we have demonstrated, humanity and its history could not have emerged from anything but some flux of random inorganic inequality in a cosmic version of what social scientists would call “short-run” disequilibrium. Rather, equality is an absolute ontological <em>tendency</em> of all things—the nature of things <em>in the long run.</em> When a theorist as honest as Rousseau finds a justificatory key for the philosophical defense of human equality in a “state of nature,” it is not that he’s wrong; he only fails to specify the exact character of this theoretical finding. The state of nature is not where humans or anything else came from but where humanity and all things return after all the false, contingent, institutional props are removed. Given our methodological reliance on circularity as the structure of existence, it’s easy to see there is hardly any difference between where everything comes from and where all things return. The very point is that the definition of existence over time is <em>going back to where it came, </em>the “it” being nothing more than the negative space between going and returning. Rousseau’s path is very much our own, so long as we insist on the caveat that the original state of nature only <em>becomes</em> the true human origin as the <em>destination</em> of all honest human thought and action.</p>

<p>The path we have taken establishes human equality not first and foremost as a moral or ethical value to be debated indefinitely—as traditional, institutionalized philosophy has always done—but as a necessary condition for philosophy and science itself. Because even the bourgeois conception of truth is unconditionally inconsistent with bias, and we have shown that any intellectual movement other than pure Socratic negativity is biased in any institutionalized status quo, nothing that wants to be truly true, philosophically or scientifically, can even proceed in the absence of absolute equality between all things, human or otherwise.</p>

<p>For now, it suffices to say that honesty is a project of mapping all things as fully as possible. However, no cute Borgesian tales on the aporias of infinity are required to see that even the fullest possible map of how things function will be unable to include itself on the map. This would only function as an objection to our project if we were asking for permission to play on the plane of truth. Rather, we are on the plane of immanence, the plane of honesty, at the truth of truth, where we neither ask nor give permission. So long as we hold fast to honesty rather than truth, all these bad infinities can be shaken off like a bad dream. Honesty, as we will continue to elaborate it and as we must begin to practice it, is a project that takes the perverse circularity of mere truth as the springboard for honestly unraveling all things everywhere, all texts, obviously, but also all institutions, all milieus, all status quo stabilities at all junctures. This is how the philosopher of today must learn to see all of life as so many layered and interconnected facades that a simple but radical honesty cannot help but performatively bring into relief as absolutely and essentially false.</p>

<p> Barely lifting the lid on things, it is already possible to see how much idiocy we are capable of explaining with one critical method. For instance, how the refrain of “I’m just being honest” is often so dishonest given that society itself is only a systematic funhouse of smoke and mirrors. This popular apology often serves to justify dishonest speech or action by referring to objective reference points as if they were reference points of the true or “real,” whereas it is perfectly clear that “objective” reference points are perfectly arbitrary rest-stops on what is nothing more than a path of routinized contingency. As Henry Miller puts it, “One can be absolutely truthful and sincere even though admittedly the most outrageous liar. Fiction and invention are of the very fabric of life.” The chief characteristic and undeniable value of a corpus such as Miller’s, this mad dreaming of an auto-didacticic Brooklyn boy, is only his refusal to be “true” within the falsity of an American twentieth-century.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if most people don’t become great artists or philosophers, is it not because they possess <em>too much</em> fidelity to the truth? We fail to achieve our glory for being too good, too decent, too truthful. Decent folks see intellectual aporia at the very outset of thought more clearly than intellectuals; they correctly determine that their painting or story or treatise will be unjustifiably partial, somehow, vaguely untrue, inauthentic somehow. So they don’t bother. For the most part, today’s artists and intellectuals are those who, at a sufficiently young age in life, decided they didn’t give a damn about the truth; but that they would seek it nonetheless, if only to spite it.</p>
