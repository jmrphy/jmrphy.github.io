    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not a lot of time right now but I want to quickly say some things about some of the recent events. My thoughts are somehow really simple and obvious but also seemingly under-reported perhaps because they are also somewhat ridiculous; that they might seem ridiculous is an index of how ridiculous is our current alienation and separation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see how Class War&rsquo;s recent &ldquo;Fuck Parade&rdquo; made quite a splash. There is probably a reason why a good old fashioned, lightly riotous march could produce some ripples it wouldn&rsquo;t have produced last year. Totally surprising, unpredictable election results; the sudden appearance of a proper socialist at the head of Labour, after so many said it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. Whenever ruling opinion is flatly contradicted by <em>events</em>, it increases our capacity to be moved by events; thus a lightly riotous march might be perceived to <em>mean something</em> now, to indicate something <em>happening</em>, and so more people will actually talk about it, think about it as a live thing that might point to something else, and so on. It can&rsquo;t be stressed enough how significant are these most minor tears in the fabric of fake status quo tranquility. Honestly I think seeking media attention is one of the worst red herrings in all of activist wisdom, but when it is received in spite of itself&mdash;try to think up something less &ldquo;media friendly&rdquo; than a &ldquo;Fuck Parade&rdquo;&mdash;it is hugely valuable as a <em>signal</em> of the status quo&rsquo;s fractures. It proves there are new openings, new connections, new corridors to rush down&mdash;new lines of flight, if you please&mdash;in this weird place they call society, which is, of course, nothing more than a weighted average of what it is perceived to be.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so important we don&rsquo;t split up and divide the events in the world according to the episodic framing provided by the media. Duh&mdash;I know&mdash;but no, really. We all do this, so badly. When liberals perennially disavow militants, and militants perennially disavow liberals, it is basically a lived sociological version of what the media does when it reports any kind of resistant political behavior as discrete and separated episodes. Even the enlighted refusal to get caught up in these sociological distributions is, obviously, one of many very well-worn ruts in the status quo fabric.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t all these little events which we either agree or disagree with, identify or disidentify with&mdash;the Corbyn surge, Fuck Parade, etc. There are simply lots of people asserting themselves against status quo institutions in all kinds of new ways, and then there is a set of status quo institutions which chop it all up to reduce it to status quo correlates. Even the radical commentariat is about as bad in this regard as the mainstream media. Revolution means all of us becoming events with each other in ways which are not ultimately reduced to current, status quo correlates. It would be a kind of mass departure from what they call reality, finding ourselves in actual reality, pleasantly unrecognizable to them.</p>

<p>In my view, Corbynism and Fuck Parade are the same thing. Events of human beings becoming themselves against status quo institutions, they are just channelled by sociology into different styles, performances, vocabularies, and identifications. To agree with one or the other&mdash;I could not think of a less interesting question. The only question is: in what way can I become a Corbyn and a Fuck Parade and a FocusE15 mum and myself, more authentically (yea I said it) and more dangerously than I ever have, in a way that draws from and feeds back to others becoming their own monstrous concoctions? Very many people think this is masturbatory Deleuzian bullshit but it&rsquo;s not; it&rsquo;s actually more concrete, practical, and credible than any other model I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>

<p>I want to see Corbyn and some Corbynites show up to the next Fuck Parade. Walk in the back or middle, don&rsquo;t have to support anything in particular but refusing to condemn anything. I want to see radicals not putting down Corbyn or Corbynites; not necessarily oozing with confidence but at least not putting out a fire themselves simply because they believe it will be put out eventually. Ridiculous idea, right? But imagine! And why not? It&rsquo;s not like radicals would lose power or momentum, they have very little of either left to themselves. It&rsquo;s not like Corbyn would lose elite respect, he doesn&rsquo;t have any to lose.</p>

<p>The main final point I want to make is that Corbyn and Corbynites actually really really need things like Fuck Parade. This one is not a provocative thought experiment, I mean that very strictly speaking.</p>

<p>Corbyn is smart and honest enough to admit he will not be able to do anything without a mass movement. He is referring to the simple maths of power, but the point is poorly understood and under-reported. The reason no Corbyn has yet to save us is because status quo institutions do not permit a Corbyn to save us. The status quo functions exactly as it should based on the current distribution of power in our society, and the laws and norms of society are precisely those which secure the current distribution of power (duh, that’s why they are there, right?). Ergo, the only possible way Corbyn could ever deliver significant but currently prohibited political and economic change is if the final variable of the equation gets a massive increase: the power of the people must literally force the stakeholders of the status quo to prefer Corbyn’s policies to what the people will do in the absence of Corbyn’s policies. When Corbyn refers to a mass movement—if he is sincere—that “mass” cannot refer to anything other than a wide diversity of folks asserting themselves against the status quo in diverse ways. It means a generalised proliferation of autonomous energies currently blocked by status quo institutions, which implies disruption of that status quo order and therefore dangerous consequences to different degrees at different times, to those invested in status quo institutions.</p>

<p>Thus, even if you are personally opposed to engaging in property destruction and foul language—such as Class War’s Fuck Parade smashing some windows here and there—you can’t sincerely wish for Corbyn to succeed <em>and</em> wish that all other human beings obey all law and etiquette. Anyone with this profile of positions is in bad faith. It is not even that, as the Stalinists would say, you can’t have an omelette without breaking some eggs. You are more than welcome to have an omelette with dairy-free egg substitute. Rooting for Corbyn and condemning Fuck Parade is like asking for an omelette, refusing to cook it, but also asking that <em>nobody else</em> cook it.</p>

<p>Not only is the proliferation of disruptive militancy necessary for Corbyn to make a dent in British politics, the more militant is the mass movement the more successful Corbyn will be. I refer to the well-documented phenomena known as the “radical flank effect.” Currently, mainstream opinion casts Corbyn as a looney-lefty too far on the fringes of respectable “realistic” opinion to be taken seriously. If there were groups of people blasting music and smashing windows in openly declared class war <em>across the UK</em>, suddenly Corbyn’s positions would become only centre-left and realistic by comparison. This would tend to pull currently skeptical centre-left voters toward Corbyn, as he would begin to seem more realistic and reasonable (and just to shut up all those troublemakers). If militant mass movement grew and escalated further, it would be in the rational self-interest of status quo stakeholders to cooperate with Corbyn, even giving him currently unthinkable political concessions, in the attempt to deligitimate and buy-off the unruly bunch.</p>

<p>If you honestly support Corbyn, your only available critique of Fuck Parade is that it remains too rare—and still too polite.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Reflections on social science, honesty, insurrection, communism, carts, and horses.</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>I took a bus from Southampton to attend the Radical Left General Assembly in London last Thursday night. I took the trip for two special reasons. The Tory victory completely flummoxed political scientists, so as a political scientist I was especially curious to see how London radicals would start filling this cognitive vacuum left open by the systematic errors of the official intelligentsia. But as someone who came into ultraleft politics through Occupy Wall Street, I have to admit the second reason I went to London that evening: I once again fell for that last temptation of the sad insurrectionary, the hope that someone else might kick off somewhere else. A few people asked me to report back and some others asked me what I thought about it. Here is my report back. There were a lot of people there. Different people said most of the usual things. It was kind of interesting at times and not at others. Most of the time all I could really think about was the image of a cart in front of a horse. Here are my personal thoughts on it. I want everyone there to succeed in everything they want to do and I’m going to do everything I can to help, no less and certainly no more.</p></li>
<li><p>As the internet fills with what everyone thinks everyone else should do now that the Tories are in power, here is what I’m <em>not</em> going to do. I’m not going to criticise the Assembly or any of the ideas expressed there. I’m not bothered. I’m glad to see anyone saying and doing anything they want, whether I think it’s ridiculous or not.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’m certainly not going to propose my brilliant vision for what everyone else should do. If there is anything I would criticise, it’s the way that our deep-seated, individual wills to power require us to express judgment of others and seek recognition from them at the same time. But I’m not going to criticise that because the only motivation for doing so is to feel smart and powerful. I don’t want to feel smart or powerful, I want collective liberation immediately. We have lots of people who are smart and who present themselves powerfully, but we do not have enough collective liberation. While correlation does not necessarily imply causation, my own wager is that there is a causal relation here.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people in the pacified capitalist democracies do not live human lives and few of us still aspire to; I don’t blame anyone, for we have been robbed and we may any day take back what belongs to us, I just think it necessary to take an honest measure of things. I’m not romantically speculating on a mythical age, it is an empirical fact that while humans persist life itself has long been going extinct. While this deserves more empirical attention than is possible here, everything seems to indicate that all of our very capacities for participating in meaningful relationships and taking risks for principled ethical convictions—essential features of any truly human life and certainly basic requirements for any liberal pluralist fantasy of organising out of contemporary domination—were unfathomably stronger across many countries even forty years ago.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> One can debate the details but to speak about movement-building while not seriously reckoning with fundamental changes in the most basic capacities of human beings cannot help but reek of bad faith.</p></li>
<li><p>People have meetings and assemblies to talk about how to stop a government. I was barely convinced that it was worth getting out of bed today and I hardly live up to my part in one or two good human relationships but OK, I’ll vote on a resolution to stop the Tory government, because that <em>sounds like</em> something a living human being would try to do. The only problem is that I’m not a living human being. For most people activism means play-acting the role of a good, living human being as a solution to the vexing and intolerably challenging <em>fact</em> that one is actually neither very good nor very living. I work 40-60 hours some weeks and 95% of everything I say on a daily basis is neither lying nor truth-telling but simple functioning for a status quo order which I absolutely know to be wrong. I can’t even smell the roses when I literally walk by roses on my way to work, and someone wants me to vote on what we should name our political movement against the government? I don’t want to do that anymore. I think that honesty is <a href="http://jmrphy.net/blog/2015/04/19/on-being-honestly-bad/">a kind of North star for finding roads to liberation</a>, for it is the only thing that can guide diverse people from diverse starting points to a destination that all parties can trust. I will come to the general assemblies and I will come to the demos and I will stand by eviction defenses and I will continue to write, but I won’t pretend to be alive by pretending to start a movement when I know perfectly well that my main problem, and probably ours, is precisely having lost the capacity to move and be moved.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a chasm between what it is reasonable to talk about in <em>serious</em> organising meetings—namely, goals, strategies, tactics, and movements—and what is often dismissed as merely antics, such as the art of well-timed defiant laughter, graffiti, random or systematic acts of queering, unspoken work slowdowns, <a href="http://jmrphy.net/blog/2012/10/20/revolutionary-fun/">fun</a>, the aesthetics of walking in mobs, pilfering and shoplifting, etc. These latter don’t qualify as the stuff of “serious organising,” and indeed they are not. What they are, however, are indications or measures of true human life bubbling up through the surface of institutions fortified primarily by instrumental seriousness; these are, in short, the only things in the world that could ever be worth organising, after the fact of their emergence. In other words, organising a “movement” presupposes some excess of human energy <em>already</em> circulating and beginning to escape the institutional order: it presupposes horses to which organisers believe we would do well to attach some carts. But today, those who speak of carts know nothing of horses; while this could certainly be forgiven, it is much harder to understand those cart mechanics who believe themselves independent of the equestrian. On the other hand, those who still ride horses have learned too well to steer clear of these odd mechanics.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p>All collectives which are able solve this puzzle, those which are able to become and attract healthy horses <em>and</em> build carts which fit well enough <em>behind  them</em> that the horses don’t prefer to flee the stables at night or otherwise die from exhaustion, will be the multiple centers of the present insurrection. For such beings it is always a present insurrection. But what does this imply for those, like me most of the time, and perhaps most people in the pacified Western countries, who are merely isolated, alienated, individual creatures? It follows that one crucial task is to intensify as much as possible the process of more openly and publicly becoming who one is with anyone else mutually attracted—and <em>everyone</em> can be certain of finding mutual attraction somewhere because in some sense this is the core operation of beauty itself, like the flower in bloom. Concretely, this refers to a process which can be summarised as follows.</p></li>
<li><p>First, I incrementally remove from my perception of the future those hesitations of calculation and calculated hesitations which together constitute my paralysing anxiety, but which are rooted only in the protection and extension of ultimately false, private investments in the status quo (material and symbolic). Each instance of doing this is well known to free up disalienating and inherently liberatory energies, and each ounce of this energy, being precisely the only fuel that could ever make any honest project run truly, is then invested in those with whom I believe I have the best chance of kicking something off. If they receive it and invest themselves in the same fashion, then this unit has achieved the most basic operation of what is called communism. From even the most minor of such communalisations, be they symbolic or material, limitlessly large groups of militant resistance can then be spun further. Building a movement for true social justice as soon as possible may only mean increasing the density of this web by any means necessary until everyone has freely and sincerely chosen it. Beyond a certain threshold (which some network-analytic research suggests may be much lower than one would think, possibly as low as 10% of people fully defected from the institutions and fully invested in the commons), the generalised ethical insurrection that is real communism becomes <em>a fait accompli</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to gain and help spread the will to live at any cost. I don’t want to fight on a plane that’s already been vanquished. To end the new government and all other unjust institutions which dominate our lives, it is enough to become ungovernable. Such a process is as amenable to serious empirical investigation, experimentation, and, ultimately, “organisation,” as any other. But to put this horse in front of our carts in many ways requires us to let go or at least, with extreme irreverence, re-invent quite a many activist truisms, “social movement” wisdoms, and inherited routines. For instance, I doubt that the name of a “movement” is something we should ever be so bored to be concerned with, a name is something status quo investors will impose on us when our will to live has revived enough that we can be said to collectively exist. But this time around it will hardly matter because we will know better than to listen to anything other than what our comrades are saying right in front of us.</p>

<p> In this light, “organising” suddenly means something very different. It becomes a matter of gaining theoretical mastery over the empirical mechanisms of radicalisation to know and practice the concrete operations which actually increase the amount of insurrectionary energy and decrease the amount of status quo inertia in the world, developing styles of life consistent with these operations but obedient to nothing, such that we become not only able to demonstrate the real and reliable empirical mechanisms which underwrite our own trajectories of liberation and therefore make us a reasonable bet for others to risk themselves on (an instrumental aspect), but also become actual life forces which draw sincere attraction by virtue of our actual truth and beauty rather than sadly begging for it as human beings we are precisely not yet becoming.</p></li>

<p>I quite liked one pamphlet I was handed, though it&rsquo;s probably indicative of something that I already read and liked it <a href="http://davidcameronsspittle.tumblr.com/">on the internet</a> the day before, and the person who handed me a copy in London didn&rsquo;t have much time to chat despite my expression of interest. I don&rsquo;t blame them, I probably seemed like a cop or something, some random American dude who doesn&rsquo;t know anybody asking questions about some pamphlet. Still, taken as a whole, I could not help but read into the evening a number of possible blockages or mis-wirings in the circuits that run from different types of public communication to relationships to action and collective change.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Not to mention a slew of other maladies which have been on the rise, including depression, interpersonal mistrust, anomie, and <a href="http://www.weareplanc.org/blog/we-are-all-very-anxious/">the dominant affect of our moment: anxiety.</a><a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>It is in this space that I understand the idea of a <a href="http://www.weareplanc.org/">Plan C:</a> Trying to take seriously the reality of contemporary experiences such as pervasive anxiety through a radically creative politics of openness and the refusal of inherited but obviously failing, activist commonplaces. For instance, the vision of <a href="http://www.weareplanc.org/blog/on-social-strikes-and-directional-demands/">an updated social strike fit to the current moment.</a> Yet this is also a good example of how I am still interested in probing further what political scientists might call the &ldquo;microfoundations&rdquo; of such a macro-level vision. I fear that even such nuanced macro-level visions still beg the question of how to get the horse in front of the cart: how to catalyze enough currently non-existing human vitality in enough quarters such that there comes into existence the <em>energy required to withdraw one&rsquo;s energy,</em> let alone invest it in communism.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <link href="http://jmrphy.github.io/blog/2015/05/12/oppression-insurrection-1/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-12T23:50:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jmrphy.github.io/blog/2015/05/12/oppression-insurrection-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A diversity of inequalities will always make revolutionary politics difficult. Of course, many previous revolutionary projects tried to solve this problem by simply ignoring some types of inequality and prioritizing the equalization of certain, select inequalities. Clearly, in the most infamous revolutionary projects of the twentieth century, class or economic inequalities were typically prioritized over other types of inequality, such as those related to race and gender. This is one of the reasons why, today, the very idea of large-scale collective insurrection is widely and quite reasonably mistrusted.</p>

<p>As consciousness of race and gender oppression displaces the failed history of class-centric revolutionary projects, to even express interest in large-scale insurrection against inequality and domination <em>as such</em>—rather than framing one’s opposition in terms of specific vectors of oppression—is often seen as suspicious and sometimes explicitly accused of erasing differences between people. The result is that we are increasingly aware of diverse vectors of institutionalized oppression which increase our felt need to overthrow all of them, at the same time we have become deeply suspicious, to the point of preemptively dismissive, of anyone too passionate about overthrowing all of them. Precisely as a generalized insurrection appears more and more necessary, activists are less and less able to speak of, let alone believe in, the very idea.</p>

<p>My argument is that the diverse types of inequality we see today, the complicated distributions of privilege and oppression which characterize modernity, actually <em>increase our collective leverage</em> against the dominant institutions and the small elite which benefit from them, while rendering elite control increasingly brittle in comparison. The main problem is that the diversity which characterizes modern society poses extraordinary interpersonal challenges for which very, very few people have any training or patience, for the understandable reason that our identities today are precisely refractions of the very divisive institutions which dominate and oppress us all differentially.</p>

<p>The reason why almost all the revolutionary projects in history fail or end with terror is precisely because they have always tried to clean an open wound with a dirty hand, over-eager to fix some things but under-concerned with fixing others. Today, in our increasingly information-based existence in which it is possible to know any fact but nearly impossible to live, we have the opposite problem: we are so aware of the dirt on our hands that we don’t believe we can fundamentally heal this collective wound which masquerades as a society. It often seems that because people sincerely don’t want to hurt anybody else, nobody wants to even dream aloud about how one could exercise revolutionary agency in one’s own way, let alone possibly in conjunction with others’ autonomous agency at some point, somehow.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I think that what we need are methods for identifying rigorously the emancipatory pathways available to different people in different situations at different times. It would seem to me that any vision for the possibility of social revolution in a society rife with diverse divisions and hierarchies would need to be composed of heterogenous battle maps for heterogenous situations. These maps should and must be made by different folks for different purposes and there does not need to be any overarching process of verification or legitimation for us to nonetheless wish, hope, and try to make them connect up to whatever degree that becomes possible. The mistake of previous revolutions has been to ask certain groups to wait for other groups; we can affirm everyone’s equal right to immediately do whatever they think most important, and we affirm our desires to attune ourselves to what others want to do, whether we understand it or not, then we can also affirm the dream of a massive and collective abolition of inequality and domination as such, without ever “prioritizing” anyone over anyone else.</p>

<p>What follows in this manuscript might be more immediately useful to those who already have certain privileges and resources which I’m lucky enough to have. I don’t know, one doesn’t know how limited is one’s perspective until one formulates it, until one takes its measure. That is probably an ineluctable condition of anyone thinking or writing anything in the contribution to collective social change. Still, I don’t know, I still believe in the possibility of individuals and groups contributing to the dream and, ultimately, the plan for concretely ushering in an era of real justice and real equality in this lifetime. I believe in at least trying to think through a process whereby diverse groups could aggregate effectively but justly into a massive insurrectionary force <em>toward</em> universal justice, understanding that a truly universal justice would have to be one that is absolutely consistent with all particular identities and desires.</p>

<p>To begin conceptually delimiting a philosophy of intersectional battle maps, of potentially infinite and absolutely autonomous units but facing only the <em>direction</em> of universal, insurrectional unity. We might begin by hypothesizing that wherever tactical opportunities open up in such a fashion that only a relatively small group of people are able to exploit them, that specific small group is a revolutionary <em>avant-garde</em> <em>of that specific front,</em> not by rights or necessity but by chance. No vanguard of “the revolution” or “the movement,” just one of many revolutionary vanguards growing from the logic that the emancipatory opportunities available today are extremely diverse and separated, and contingent on the different positions occupied by different individuals distributed across our hierarchical and divided societies.</p>

<p>And it is no criticism of the individuals first possessed of certain revolutionary perturbations that they are merely “privileged” or “bourgeois” as if that disqualifies them from the resistance. It is a conservative, bourgeois ideology to critique revolutionaries for having a bourgeois background, for not only is it a patently _ad hominem_ argument, it’s effect is to disqualify a faction of society which is sometimes the only faction with the material resources (time, education, technology, etc.), to undertake certain types of activity in certain times or places. Just as there will be crucial types of activity which, I imagine, could only be done by the less privileged. If someone is truly revolutionary, their only function is to spread freedom through contagion from <em>wherever they find themselves</em>, to embody a freedom whose specific nature and function is to proliferate and multiply itself through a process I’ve modeled elsewhere with respect to the political vanguard and according to which the avant-garde will expand just as well.
The simple reason why the avant-garde as well as the vanguard have been critical concepts in art and politics is not because there need to be leaders, as in the disastrously erroneous doctrines of someone like Lenin. The limited quantity of representatives in any emergent avant-garde or vanguard is simply a function of the evolutionary fact that everything has to start somewhere, with some minor perturbation in the system.</p>

<p>In some sense this is good, because perhaps it means the pendulum has swung away from authoritarian tendencies, and perhaps it means that the next massive revolution to shake the world will be constitutionally incapable of lapsing into authoritarian terror. But in another sense, it is clearly a peculiar pathology for an allergy to authoritarianism to become a kind of authoritarian norm precluding the possibility of a generalized explosion of diverse freedoms.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many people believe it is possible to win a good and just society by organizing a counter-power to change status quo institutions. But when was the last time you heard any convincing argument or up-to-date evidence that this is still the case? Almost everyone who still holds this belief does so as an assumption inherited from some previous era of struggle.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Many people will frankly admit they hold this belief simply because it is necessary to have hope against all odds, but this is wrong: it is necessary to know what is really the case, and anyway, a truthful renunciation of hope is both more joyful and more politically effective than an empirically implausible hope. While many, many people have been trying for a very long time to organize counter-power on the assumption that it exists and only has to be organized, very few people will even consider the idea that total defeat is a possibility, let alone that it may have already happened.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>What if activists and organizers are so concerned with building the best carriage they have failed to notice their horses have already fled?</p>

<p>First of all, <em>if</em> this were the case, there are two reasons we almost certainly would not yet have realized it. The first is that the information revolution has increased the speed of all state and corporate operations much more drastically and much earlier than it did so for any of us. So even if state-corporate domination was officially cemented thirty years ago, it’s perfectly possible we would not yet have received the memo.</p>

<p>The second reason, an endemic pitfall of all activism, is that to grow even a modest movement requires appealing to people, and appealing to people requires activists to peddle hope and optimism <em>despite</em> any changes in the objective conditions warranting hope and optimism. If anything, objective decreases in the conditions for hope lead activists to increase their messages of hope in compensation. It is built into the DNA of traditional “strategic” activism to not honestly update its messaging based on changes in empirical reality. If one takes these two considerations seriously, one begins to see how so many of the activist truisms handed down since the first modern trade unions in the late 19th century are laced with dishonesty and compose a picture of the world no less erroneous for the good intentions of its painters.</p>

<p>The fact is that our “popular” power to control the institutions which govern our lives is now contained, channelled, and otherwise exhausted by political and economic institutions more completely than ever before in the history of the world. On one side we have the global super-rich who move freely and untouchably above all nation states. On the other side, we have the actual human beings of the world who are increasingly overworked, anxious, depressed, frustrated, self-loathing, mistrustful, unequally divided by race, gender, and diverse other categories, locked into the most sophisticated police states ever designed and, despite all of this, on the whole, more zealously invested in the mundane fascism of this everyday life than we were even thirty years ago. In such a fully pacified and one-dimensional world, the idea of organizing and outsmarting the pilots of dominant institutions <em>on the plane of power</em> is a delusional narcissistic fantasy working from a cheap tourist map of political history. I fully affirm the desire and possibility of outsmarting the pilots of dominant institutions, but not by competing upon the very plane which has already been conclusively vanquished.</p>

<p>The next best move in the world history of resistance is at once obvious and difficult to parse. If you lose a game of chess because your opponent moved extra pieces while you weren’t looking, but the cheater is not disqualified because they’re buddies with the referee, what do you? According to the official record, <em>reality</em>, you are a loser but you know that you did not truly lose. So what do you do? Maybe you ask the audience to lobby the referee so they can get their false defeats changed also. While some agree with you, they don’t have the energy for a fight, and the rest just point to the record and correctly say the reality is you lost.</p>

<p>So what do you do? Because governments within capitalism cannot over-regulate all behavior, there are lots of contexts in which you have no power but can still act creatively without imprisonment. This is perhaps the Achille’s heel of liberal capitalism. In this case, since it’s just a chess game and nobody yet gets arrested for poor board-game etiquette, what you do is turn over the table, maniacally excoriate everybody in the room, and leave laughing in a blaze of useless opposition. Not because you have some kind of secret micro-power with which to challenge the referee’s, and not to build a movement to overpower the referee, but precisely because you know the recorded reality is false and  unjust but you desire to live truly despite neither you nor anyone in the audience having the power to do so. Then, only as a by-product of you risking yourself on what you know to be true, lo and behold, on your sad and lonely walk home, a few people from the audience run up to you because they thought what you did was weird and funny and vaguely cool and at the very least not boring.</p>

<p>And you all plan to stay in touch and meet again, and then you start to drift from those old “friends” in the audience who agreed with your frustration but hung their head in shame when you had the nerve to think a silly chess match was a place for life to take place. Then you finally realize that for those people, for the entire audience that is most of society, there is no situation in which it is ever appropriate for life to truly take place, and the only sense of life you ever feel is with those few, new friends you made in your fall from the audience of appropriateness. Then each of you begins to follow up with anyone else who is falling from appropriateness in favor of making life take place. In this way, without going to any bullshit meetings or following any supposedly strategic catechism, only by directly increasing the truth and joy of your life, you find yourself as part of a collective movement at war with everything that is false and unjust. That sad need for hope which is characteristic of activist entrepreneurs vanishes at the point one sets off on the real process of becoming who one is.</p>

<p>This is the only model of activism in any context where institutional domination is so advanced that “organizing” justice seems impossible. Instead of building carriages for an empty stable of horses, we should rather just become horses.</p>

<p>In this fashion, despite the absolute absence of power to change status quo institutions, whatever life still exists inside the dead inertia of the institutional spectacle can find itself and become a collective life-form while the putrid carcasses of the institutions, however much we may remain locked inside of them, can nonetheless be forgotten and left to rot. Although the representatives of the institutions will incorrectly believe they have all the power, this time it is they who will be duped before they even realize it: for despite the continued domination of institutions, everyone will have simply evacuated the plane of their power for ours, the plane of true life.</p>

<p>Of course, dynamics such as these are often killed by a variety of other pacifying pressures emitted by the institutions. Work, debt, bills, certain idiot friends and family members, the general inertia of “path dependence”, all make it hard to fully follow through on such ruptures in the social fabric as that which graced our chess player, those opportunities where one could maybe dodge down some completely new set of relationships, energies, and collective forms-of-life. But that is in large part because we don’t currently see such momentary ruptures for what they truly are, the microscopic but real stuff of which world-historical insurrections can be made. We currently don’t dodge down such paths of becoming because we incorrectly think we have so much to lose within the institutions (all of our status quo investments, typically most of our whole lives’ meanings) and very little confidence that such a risky move would be sensible or coherent, let alone constitutive of a real process of collective liberation.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> In all works such as this little volume of writings, and anytime you and others publicly choose truth and joy over lying and dying, we decrease the hold of status quo fears by increasing the reality of life beyond the institutions.</p>

<p>And with every minor, daily victory of joy over death, we gain a few extra resources—if only of energy—which can be spent on deflecting the pacifying pressures which crush our friends. And we will continue to devise new and different life-forms specifically suited to chip away at these pacifying pressures, lowering the threshold at which others will find it possible to initiate their own liberatory defections and inventions.</p>

<p>The goal here is not to build a theoretical system or a social movement but to demonstrate the theoretically and empirically valid political consequences of certain everyday life options, in order to increase the confidence and frequency with which I and others take the risks necessary to construct collective life amid the institutional deaths we are all currently suffering. As for “unifying” or “organizing,” there is no need; anyone who travels down this path will find each other in the end, not out of some “strategic” catechism some social movement expert wants us to recite, but simply because by doing what <em>actually works</em> to increase truth and joy against the institutions, we will all by definition be moving toward the same destination, only from inherently different and complicated starting points.</p>

<p>I do not believe I have ever seen or heard anyone even try to justify this belief while accounting for all of the various ways in which the distribution of power has shifted against the majority of people in the past several decades. I am thinking of the information revolution, globalization, inequality, and rising levels of mistrust, depression, anxiety, and social anomie, among many other empirical facts awareness of which makes the average activist meeting today feel like live-action role-playing inside of a mausoleum.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>I blame that vulgar Foucauldianism which serves at once as apology and consolation for submission by casting it as future subversion waiting in the wings, but that would deserve another discussion entirely.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Movies produced by status quo institutions mock this type of vision as symptomatic of naive childishness or mid-life crises, representing this type of life-changing rupture toward greater freedom as empty fantasy which never amounts to anything real, but the only reason such desires rarely come to anything in real life is only because status quo culture mocks these desires. It is precisely by this kind of circular process that status quo institutions prevent the contagious multiplication of radically creative and dangerous life-forms: to prove that radical deviations from the mainstream are naive and impossible, their only evidence is the vast sea of souls who have become deadened by this repeated, false assertion.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Supposedly, the youth are naive and idealistic because they believe in changing the world, until adulthood comes and teaches them the hard lessons of reality. But this is only an ideological fantasy which conveniently assuages the guilt of adults at the same time it deludes and flatters the youth. In fact, for several decades now the youth have been <em>denied access</em> to the naive idealism which is their birthright but for which they nonetheless continue to be mocked. All better to push the youth into an uncritical stupor which was once only imaginable in the  most resigned of the elderly. To make the youth as stupid as adults: education today.</p>

<p>Many of the people who use one hand to mock the youth for their naive idealism use their other hand to stuff the youth with advertisements and work and patriotism and law and order. These odd, hypocritical creatures, these <em>respectable adults,</em> mock the children they themselves have killed.</p>

<p>If indeed the tendency of youth is naive idealism, as I hear so often, then I’d like to know why I never had such pleasures in my own youth. The most naive idealism I ever knew in my youth was American-style libertarianism, Ayn Rand and the cult of “individual rights.” I honestly can’t remember anyone who sincerely and passionately believed in fundamental changes to the dominant status quo institutions. Certainly I knew people who sincerely aspired to do good, and of course the liberal faith in non-profit organizations was not uncommon. But aspirations toward social justice within coordinates defined by currently existing institutions are longings to <em>intensify</em> the status quo rather than fundamentally change it. Such youthful aspirations are not at all naive or idealistic but eminently realistic and practical. So if it’s true that the youth are naive and idealistic, then my generation was robbed.</p>

<p>I blame the <em>respectable adults.</em> It must have been these dubious creatures because no matter how far and wide I look for idealistic youths, all I can find anywhere are <em>respectable adults</em>. They’re everywhere, sometimes even in the bodies of teenagers. And you just <em>know</em> they’re the culprits because when you ask them how things could possibly have gotten this bad, they blame a dozen factors all of which conveniently have nothing to do with their own responsibility, before finally changing the topic to something more “realistic.”</p>

<p>The silent, guilty conscience of the respectable adult has abandoned us—the youth and the not yet capitulated young adults—to a life without compass. And then, as we do our best to navigate the impenetrable fog of lies which we have only inherited, the same respectable adults mock us to discourage us, because to disentangle ourselves would be to disentangle <em>their</em> bad faith. This is why most respectable adults want us to suffer as they suffer, and it is why they really do actively discourage us from seeking liberation, because our liberation would inevitably shatter many of the fragile excuses which they need to make their own shameless complacency livable.</p>

<p>But now, well past the prime of my youth though only at the doorstep of real adulthood, neither have I met with those hard lessons in which reality is supposed to teach me the virtues of reasonable moderation. The only lesson adult reality has taught me so far is that if you’re born into a certain minimum of privilege and work extremely hard, you may be lucky enough to survive in modest comfort so long as you’re willing to invest most of your entire life’s energy into institutions which you know damn well effectively prohibit the very possibility of honest and ethical human co-existence. I would much rather be belittled for my immaturity than admired for a mature bad faith.</p>

<p>It seems the real crisis today has nothing to do with the youth: the real crisis is that we have far too many <em>respectable adults</em> running amok. Just look at them, running around working bullshit jobs, dying from stress and anxiety and guilt, repeating lies they’ve now forgotten to be lies, and bequeathing to the youth an increasingly unsalvageable worldview just to avoid admitting that somewhere along the line they failed and gave up. How much more we would love and respect them if only they could be honest!</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, <em>respectable adults</em> pose no challenge and do not even have to be resisted. As ethical and political deadweights, they need only be forgotten.</p>

<p><em>My</em> only concern is not to become one.</p>
