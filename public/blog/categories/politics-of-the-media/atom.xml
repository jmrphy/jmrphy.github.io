<h5>Thoughts on Walter Lippmann</h5>




<p>pp 6. Lippmann writes as if the antagonism determined by national geo-politics is more real than the lived relations of human beings. He thinks in all honesty that they were mistaken to have been acting as friends!</p>




<p>But isn&#39;t it far more reasonable to say that indeed they were friends, despite the war, because they knew nothing of any reasons to oppose one another? And that it was only the media, which acted as a sort of informational tentacle of the state, which informed them that they should be opposed to one another? The news delivery functioned as a sort of order, and here Lippman testifies to this insofar as he literally attributes the messages of national war propaganda more reality than lived relations.</p>




<p>Isn&#39;t this really extraordinary? He suggests that there is a real world outside and merely a picture in our heads, but is it not far more reasonable to say that the world we live with the people around is the world outside and newspaper reports of national state propaganda are \( quite literally! \) only pictures?</p>




<p>We should question what permits him such confidence to suggest the opposite, despite how absurd this is.</p>




<p>p.15: One can think of the fidelity of news reports as a distribution. we tend to think of it as a distribution from left to right politically, but the more interesting distinction to me is the distribution across which a report locates systemic institutional causes or an ideological picture of the status quo which benefits both sides of the status quo spectrum.</p>




<p>p.18: Today, it seems to me that we certainly all live in a variously different world in no small part to the explosion of media choice, but the political issue here is very different than what Lippman identified in the 1920s. It is not that the rich and poor live in different worlds in which they believe the other to be an enemy, it is that they live in different worlds in which they do not see each other as enemies. This strikes me as the remarkable fact today, and it would have to be determined how this came about. One might hypothesis that the market&#39;s explosion of media choice and advertising&#39;s ability to create various specific identity niches solved the &ldquo;class war&rdquo; by simply removing any common ground required for even having any antagonism whatsoever.</p>




<p>p.26: what is interesting about Lippman is that he says the press cannot be expected to supply the truth about the world, because they are too much determined by precisely the political forces which distort our image of the world. </p>
