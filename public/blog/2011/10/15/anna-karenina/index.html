	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">Anna Karenina</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For the past two minutes I’ve been <br/>
Typing with one hand because <br/>
In the other hand was a bagel, <br/>
Until I ate it all. <br/>
I liked the bagel and I like <br/>
Typing like this and <br/>
And it all just made <br/>
Me think I would like <br/>
To write you a poem in this <br/>
Fashion because poems let one say <br/>
Many serious things at once <br/>
And not be too serious <br/>
Or many stupid things at once <br/>
And seem interesting or deep or <br/>
Profound or even trenchant.</p>

<p>The bagel was not a metaphor, <br/>
Just how this really happened, <br/>
Although it is also a metaphor, <br/>
The bagel being you, <br/>
And the typing being <br/>
A female minimalist lo-fi electro pop <br/>
Musician playing a “synth,” <br/>
A thing that works <br/>
I know not how.</p>

<p>Anyway, the plan for this “piece,” <br/>
Is to read it to you one day or night <br/>
In your studio, which has very low lighting <br/>
By the way, <br/>
At a time when you’ve just finished working, <br/>
And make you think <br/>
I’m serious but not too serious and <br/>
Interesting or deep or profound <br/>
Or even trenchant and maybe make <br/>
You like me just a little bit more than <br/>
Maybe you do now maybe. <br/>
Today I saw one of my best friends <br/>
In the world and she cried because <br/>
Her boyfriend dumped her and I <br/>
Cried too because her boyfriend <br/>
Dumped her and it made her cry. <br/>
I hope you don’t get a boyfriend <br/>
Because I don’t want you to cry if <br/>
he dumps you but I <br/>
don’t think he would <br/>
do that, although if he did <br/>
I would secretly be happy.</p>

<p>I thought for a second that <br/>
I might try to “express my feelings” <br/>
To you in this poem, <br/>
But then it occurred to me that <br/>
I could just keep “beating around the bush” <br/>
And write hundreds of poems <br/>
Just kind of “getting to the point” <br/>
And just never quite “get to the point,” <br/>
And that this would probably <br/>
Make greater works of art <br/>
Than somehow just “getting to the point,” <br/>
Which I can’t really do outside of poetry so <br/>
Why would I be able to do it inside of poetry <br/>
Inside of your art studio, <br/>
Which has low lighting, <br/>
By the way?</p>

<p>The low lighting, by the way, <br/>
Is not a metaphor, <br/>
Just how this is really happening, <br/>
Although it is also a metaphor, <br/>
The light being the truth itself or <br/>
A female minimalist lo-fi electro pop <br/>
Musician playing a “synth,” <br/>
The light’s low level being <br/>
How the “synth” works, <br/>
Which I do not know about.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason this “piece” <br/>
Has to be performed in your studio <br/>
Is that when you are not working <br/>
For money this is always where <br/>
You want to be with your free time <br/>
First and foremost and then when <br/>
You are done sometimes we <br/>
Hang out maybe and when I have <br/>
Free time I read and write <br/>
First and foremost and then when <br/>
I am done sometimes we hang out maybe <br/>
And this might seem like a stupidly trivial <br/>
Observation but since now <br/>
It’s in a poem and I am reading it <br/>
In your art studio, which has very low <br/>
Lighting by the way, it kind of <br/>
Represents how what you do here <br/>
First and foremost <br/>
Is the most important thing <br/>
And what I do elsewhere <br/>
First and foremost  <br/>
Is the most important thing and now, <br/>
Right here, the two most imporant <br/>
Things are kind of in the <br/>
Same place so that as soon as I <br/>
Finish reading the last word of this <br/>
I guess the truth is I’m just hoping <br/>
That you’ll like me just a little more <br/>
Than maybe you do now maybe, <br/>
(And I’ll like you a little more too, maybe) <br/>
Because as I finish reading the very last word, <br/>
Even though I never really expressed <br/>
Anything clearly or “got to the point,” <br/>
The air in your studio <br/>
Which has low lighting by the way, <br/>
will sort of vibrate <br/>
For a tenth of a second and <br/>
I think that will be art.</p>
