<p>October 15, 2011</p>

<p>For the past two minutes I’ve been
Typing with one hand because
In the other hand was a bagel,
Until I ate it all.
I liked the bagel and I like
Typing like this and
And it all just made
Me think I would like
To write you a poem in this
Fashion because poems let one say
Many serious things at once
And not be too serious
Or many stupid things at once
And seem interesting or deep or
Profound or even trenchant.</p>

<p>The bagel was not a metaphor,
Just how this really happened,
Although it is also a metaphor,
The bagel being you,
And the typing being
A female minimalist lo-fi electro pop
Musician playing a “synth,”
A thing that works
I know not how.</p>

<p>Anyway, the plan for this “piece,”
Is to read it to you one day or night
In your studio, which has very low lighting
By the way,
At a time when you’ve just finished working,
And make you think
I’m serious but not too serious and
Interesting or deep or profound
Or even trenchant and maybe make
You like me just a little bit more than
Maybe you do now maybe.
Today I saw one of my best friends
In the world and she cried because
Her boyfriend dumped her and I
Cried too because her boyfriend
Dumped her and it made her cry.
I hope you don’t get a boyfriend
Because I don’t want you to cry if
he dumps you but I
don’t think he would
do that, although if he did
I would secretly be happy.</p>

<p>I thought for a second that
I might try to “express my
Feelings” to you in this poem,
But then it occurred to me that
I could just keep “beating
Around the bush” and write
Hundreds of poems
Just kind of
“getting to the point”
and just never quite
“get to the point,”
and that this would
probably make greater
works of art
than somehow just
“getting to the point,”
which I can’t really do
outside of poetry so
why would I be able
to do it inside of poetry
inside of your art studio,
which has low lighting,
by the way?</p>

<p>The low lighting, by the way,
Is not a metaphor,
Just how this is really happening,
Although it is also a metaphor,
The light being the truth itself or
A female minimalist lo-fi electro pop
Musician playing a “synth,”
The light’s low level being
How the “synth” works,
Which I do not know about.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason this “piece”
Has to be performed in your studio
Is that when you are not working
For money this is always where
You want to be with your free time
First and foremost and then when
You are done sometimes we
Hang out maybe and when I have
Free time I read and write
First and foremost and then when
I am done sometimes we hang out maybe
And this might seem like a stupidly trivial
Observation but since now
It’s in a poem and I am reading it
In your art studio, which has very low
Lighting by the way, it kind of
Represents how what you do here
First and foremost
Is the most important thing
And what I do elsewhere
First and foremost
Is the most important thing and now,
Right here, the two most imporant
Things are kind of in the
Same place so that as soon as I
Finish reading the last word of this
I guess the truth is I’m just hoping
That you’ll like me just a little more
Than maybe you do now maybe,
(And I’ll like you a little more too, maybe)
Because as I finish reading the very last word,
Even though I never really expressed
Anything clearly or “got to the point,”
The air in your studio
Which has low lighting by the way,
will sort of vibrate
For a tenth of a second and
I think that will be art.</p>
