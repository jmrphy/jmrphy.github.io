<p>Hello there are about 18 people living here right now depending on what you call people and living but … and if you are here or there from … better than doing research on the place … third a third third a friend of a friend.</p>

<p>yeah so one of the things about this place and living with so many people living in a big warehouse and all and radical politics is that if you want things that you will soon want, that it’s like, on this village… but unfortunately it’s rather in the middle of a ticket going like some lingering derek and it’s quite like describing them like american cars, noxious because it’s politically in cold, really truly and kind of like… there’s a lifestyle it is like, broke possibly, but diverse and kind of real possibly… Unlikely I can put very improbable kind of words to it… convergence of the people pass here but… when a lot of people in your house have radical aspirations and kinda radical positions but the actual reality of it… surprisingly incredulously thick and we’re still kind of only just beginning really to understand… for ourselves, the community… that’s what they said that’s kind of happening lately and it’s kinda been like pointing itself out… as early as I was calling you… yeah so that’s the… for room and we went okay so we did a little loop around there… we can just go this way then… city so… this is the bathroom this is the main bathroom … otherwise known as the green bathroom or the tiger bathroom about there this is the only shower … and some of it most of it but … no I mean, looks like the hook ups were here about when we first moved in we had to … yeah we used to pay some guy but recently some occupiers from new haven these kids we know they&rsquo;ve been living in last week or two and they’re often knowing well really handy and in addition they’re fucking rad anyway so we&rsquo;re thinking hoping they&rsquo;re going to stay.</p>

<p>We are all guilty we are all guilty but the only thing we&rsquo;ve ever done that&rsquo;s dangerous the only crime we ever committed hey is unused potential, the shell, being ignored or pressed hey all we are dead and wait and we&rsquo;re dead space.</p>

<p>Hello that … hi this is … because he</p>
